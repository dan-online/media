00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,360
<font size="36">All right! OK!</font>

00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,520
<font size="36">All right! Yes! OK!</font>

4
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,800
<font size="36">OK!</font>

5
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,040
<font size="36">Wow!</font>

6
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,440
<font size="36">I know you want a party,
but I have to say thank you</font>

7
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,240
<font size="36">to a few people after what has been
a momentous week for this company.</font>

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,280
<font size="36">Project Icarus has increased
our productivity tenfold.</font>

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,240
<font size="36">Every department is working at three
times the usual speed due to the</font>

10
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,280
<font size="36">increased interconnectivity
of our computer system.</font>

11
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,840
<font size="36">Good, good, good. Okaaaay!</font>

12
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,960
<font size="36">How can I talk about all that
computer stuff, all of that computer</font>

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
<font size="36">gobbledegook without
saying a word about the lawyers?</font>

14
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,920
<font size="36">They cut the red tape. They cut
the red tape. They cut the red tape.</font>

15
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,280
<font size="36">Come on! Yes!</font>

16
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,520
<font size="36">You cut it! You cut it! You cut it!</font>

17
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,440
<font size="36">That's enough. And when you're
talking about computers, how can</font>

18
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,120
<font size="36">you fail to mention Accounts?</font>

19
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,440
<font size="36">Yes!</font>

20
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,760
<font size="36">He's building up to us, he must be.</font>

21
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,120
<font size="36">And finally, last but not least.</font>

22
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,760
<font size="36">< Champagne.</font>

23
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:51,560
<font size="36">These three people proved
time and again that they have</font>

24
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,280
<font size="36">the right stuff.</font>

25
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,160
<font size="36">The toilet cleaners!</font>

26
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,840
<font size="36">They said we couldn't do it.
They said outsourcing our toilet</font>

27
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,840
<font size="36">cleaning would be inefficient.</font>

28
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,840
<font size="36">Dirk, Banhead and Doodles
proved them wrong.</font>

29
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,200
<font size="36">Toilets!</font>

30
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,920
<font size="36">That's right, Doodles.</font>

31
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,680
<font size="36">Where are you going?</font>

32
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,400
<font size="36">They do this every time.</font>

33
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,400
<font size="36">They never remember us.</font>

34
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,080
<font size="36">They... You did the work.</font>

35
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,520
<font size="36">We did all the work.</font>

36
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,120
<font size="36">Does this mean we're not
going to the thank-you party.</font>

37
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,360
<font size="36">Course we're not. Why would
we go? We weren't thanked.</font>

38
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,760
<font size="36">RINGS</font>

39
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,920
<font size="36">Hello. IT. Have you tried
turning it off and on again?</font>

40
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,440
<font size="36">Have you tried
sticking it up your arse?</font>

41
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,160
<font size="36">Oh,...yeah, yeah.</font>

42
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,600
<font size="36">I just realised that was my mother.</font>

43
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:52,800
<font size="36">Oh, I was really looking forward
to that, you know. Fancied a dance.</font>

44
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,080
<font size="36">I'm glad the toilet guys
got the nod, though.</font>

45
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,480
<font size="36">They do good work.
Have you been to the toilets on 12th?</font>

46
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,960
<font size="36">It's like going on holiday
and I try not to go at home now.</font>

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,520
<font size="36">I save it up.</font>

48
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,880
<font size="36">Oh, Jesus! Will you please
do something about that poster?</font>

49
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,840
<font size="36">What poster?
Oh, bloody drawer.</font>

50
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,200
<font size="36">The one with the monkey
- it's horrible.</font>

51
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,640
<font size="36">What's wrong with the monkey?
He's not horrible. He's lovely.</font>

52
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,800
<font size="36">He's a lovely little monkey.</font>

53
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,400
<font size="36">What's he doing in goal?</font>

54
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,680
<font size="36">Not that monkey. That monkey.</font>

55
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,840
<font size="36">Oh, right.
Well, that is a bit frightening.</font>

56
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,680
<font size="36">Anyway, I'd better fix this drawer.</font>

57
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,560
<font size="36">Moss, do you have the hammer?</font>

58
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,480
<font size="36">You're not listening to me!
I hate it when people don't listen!</font>

59
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,200
<font size="36">Oh, God.</font>

60
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,600
<font size="36">High-end screeching.</font>

61
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,160
<font size="36">Like someone's killing a cat.</font>

62
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,200
<font size="36">A kind of shouty cat.</font>

63
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,320
<font size="36">Oh, God. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.</font>

64
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,440
<font size="36">I'm just...I'm just a little
bit...you know, you know.</font>

65
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,120
<font size="36">What?</font>

66
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,840
<font size="36">Well, I've got,
you know, at the moment, so...</font>

67
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,760
<font size="36">What?</font>

68
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,640
<font size="36">I've got Aunt Irma visiting.</font>

69
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,680
<font size="36">Oh. Do you not like Aunt Irma?</font>

70
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,240
<font size="36">I've got an aunt like that.</font>

71
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,640
<font size="36">It's my term for
my time of the month.</font>

72
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,360
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

73
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,120
<font size="36">What time of the month? The weekend?</font>

74
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,200
<font size="36">No.</font>

75
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,520
<font size="36">Does Aunt Irma visit on the weekend?</font>

76
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,440
<font size="36">Moss...</font>

77
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,640
<font size="36">You know, it's high tide.</font>

78
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,760
<font size="36">But we're not on the coast.</font>

79
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,280
<font size="36">I'm closed for maintenance.</font>

80
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,600
<font size="36">Closed for maintenance?</font>

81
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,320
<font size="36">Moss!</font>

82
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,120
<font size="36">I've fallen to the Communists.</font>

83
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,240
<font size="36">Well, they do have
some strong arguments.</font>

84
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,200
<font size="36">Carrie, Moss. First scene in Carrie.</font>

85
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,960
<font size="36">Oh, OK.</font>

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,360
<font size="36">Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no,</font>

87
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,120
<font size="36">yeah, no, Uh-uh.</font>

88
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,120
<font size="36">Yeah, you know, people tell me I'm</font>

89
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,800
<font size="36">not great during this time,
so I thought I should warn you.</font>

90
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,000
<font size="36">Right, not great in what way?</font>

91
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,000
<font size="36">Just generally.
I'm not great to be around, so</font>

92
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,880
<font size="36">try not to get on my nerves.</font>

93
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,520
<font size="36">I've had a few girlfriends.</font>

94
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,720
<font size="36">I'm not completely oblivious.
You won't even know I'm here.</font>

95
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,520
<font size="36">Oh, when this is working,
the action on it's so great.</font>

96
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,280
<font size="36">Look at that. So smooth.</font>

97
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,480
<font size="36">Stop doing that!</font>

98
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,800
<font size="36">Oh-aagh!</font>

99
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,320
<font size="36">Oh, my God! Sorry, sorry.</font>

100
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,400
<font size="36">But you see what I mean?
You have to be careful.</font>

101
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,760
<font size="36">I'll be careful.</font>

102
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,520
<font size="36">Has she gone yet?</font>

103
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,160
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

104
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,360
<font size="36">What was all that about? Cor,
dear me. Ladies. God bless 'em.</font>

105
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,400
<font size="36">What would we do without them?
With their ways.</font>

106
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,000
<font size="36">Their mysterious seasons,</font>

107
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:47,840
<font size="36">the moon, Glenn Close, Sheena Easton,
all the different kinds of women.</font>

108
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,080
<font size="36">Oh, smashing.</font>

109
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,760
<font size="36">Oh, my appointment. I've got
to go and see the psychiatrist.</font>

110
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,440
<font size="36">I can't believe
there's a psychiatrist here.</font>

111
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,800
<font size="36">All because those two
from Accounts just had enough
and wanted to go to the seaside.</font>

112
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,960
<font size="36">The seaside?
They committed suicide, Roy.</font>

113
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,200
<font size="36">That's right. Yes, of course.
Why do you have to go and see her?</font>

114
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,680
<font size="36">Oh, because I said
Jen was dead that time.</font>

115
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,840
<font size="36">Oh, yeah, yeah, that'll be it.</font>

116
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:20,120
<font size="36">She said it was something only
a severely disturbed person would do</font>

117
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,160
<font size="36">and that now I have to spend a lot
of time in therapy. Isn't that great?</font>

118
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,640
<font size="36">Oh, well, yes,
that's clearly terrific.</font>

119
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,280
<font size="36">No, no, that's bad.
Why do you think that's great?</font>

120
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,440
<font size="36">The psychiatrist
is a very attractive lady.</font>

121
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,640
<font size="36">Ah, I see. She's of the female...</font>

122
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,040
<font size="36">Genre, yes.</font>

123
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,640
<font size="36">A Dr Melfi to your Tony Soprano.</font>

124
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,680
<font size="36">She's a glamorous older woman.</font>

125
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,960
<font size="36">Oh, the things
you could learn from her.</font>

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
<font size="36">Or from any woman.</font>

127
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,240
<font size="36">Is Jen in her office?
I need to get her to sign something.</font>

128
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,200
<font size="36">Um, yeah...
Moss, Moss, don't get on her nerves.</font>

129
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,280
<font size="36">How would I get on her nerves?</font>

130
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,600
<font size="36">Hello?</font>

131
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,360
<font size="36">GROWL</font>

132
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,480
<font size="36">Shouldn't I be on the couch?</font>

133
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,920
<font size="36">No, Maurice, not today.</font>

134
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,680
<font size="36">I've got some good news.
I think you've turned a corner.</font>

135
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,440
<font size="36">I'm not going on the couch?</font>

136
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,160
<font size="36">You don't need me any more.</font>

137
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,200
<font size="36">What?</font>

138
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,400
<font size="36">Well, there's obviously
nothing wrong with you</font>

139
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,520
<font size="36">and I think you're ready
to do without our sessions.</font>

140
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,160
<font size="36">But I've been feeling depressed.</font>

141
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,360
<font size="36">Really? Why?</font>

142
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,840
<font size="36">Because I'm pregnant.</font>

143
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,560
<font size="36">What?</font>

144
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,240
<font size="36">I mean,
I had a dream that I was pregnant.</font>

145
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,320
<font size="36">Well, there's
nothing unusual about that.</font>

146
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,400
<font size="36">But when I had the baby, I looked
down and saw that it was my father.</font>

<font size="36">Things that are dark.</font>

157

158
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,800

that you are suicidal.</font>

know Smarties made a cereal.</font>

204

Smarties in a bowl with milk.</font>

It's too much sugar, that's all.</font>

330
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,360
<font size="36">I have to tell you I've a
little confession to make.</font>

331
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,120
<font size="36">As you may or may not know,
for ethical reasons,</font>

332
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,680
<font size="36">I'm required not to have any
relations with any of my patients.</font>

333
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,520
<font size="36">But for the last few months,
I've been developing some...</font>

334
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,440
<font size="36">warm feelings towards you.</font>

335
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,400
<font size="36">And the real reason
I terminated your therapy</font>

336
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,440
<font size="36">was so that I could explore</font>

337
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,960
<font size="36">some of these feelings.</font>

338
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,560
<font size="36">I see.</font>

339
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:27,960
<font size="36">I was wondering, when you were
working in your job with the girls,</font>

340
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,960
<font size="36">if things ever got on top of you,
what would you do to...relax?</font>

341
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
<font size="36">We'd have a big girls' night out.</font>

342
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,120
<font size="36">I'd love that, actually,</font>

343
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,720
<font size="36">a big girly night out.</font>

344
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,800
<font size="36">Fat chance of that round here.</font>

345
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,880
<font size="36">Not necessarily.</font>

346
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,600
<font size="36">Mum?!</font>

347
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,040
<font size="36">This is my psychiatrist.</font>

348
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:08,640
<font size="36">Oh, no, I'm sorry, it's just that
you look exactly like my mother.</font>

349
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:14,880
<font size="36">No, but don't be offended by that,
she's a very sexy woman.</font>

350
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,760
<font size="36">Not that I would
want to have sex with her.</font>

351
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,400
<font size="36">I know that that's what you
psychiatrists think,</font>

352
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,880
<font size="36">but I swear to God that there's
nothing to it in my case.</font>

353
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,520
<font size="36">My mother wouldn't stand for
any of that kind of nonsense.</font>

354
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,360
<font size="36">I can just hear her now.</font>

355
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,840
<font size="36">"What are you doing, Roy?
What are you doing?!"</font>

356
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,320
<font size="36">You handled that well.</font>

357
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,400
<font size="36">That's the psychiatrist?!</font>

358
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,040
<font size="36">I think she's my girlfriend now.</font>

359
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,840
<font size="36">Whoa! No, Moss, listen to me.
You can never see that woman again.</font>

360
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,760
<font size="36">She looks exactly like my mother.</font>

361
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,200
<font size="36">You're exaggerating.</font>

362
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,600
<font size="36">She's the spit of her!</font>

363
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,080
<font size="36">What went on in there?</font>

364
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,840
<font size="36">Right, OK,</font>

to a big girls' night out?</font>

372
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,680
<font size="36">No! It was heartwarming!</font>

373
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,720
<font size="36">Well, I feel like a princess, Roy,</font>

374
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,480
<font size="36">and don't tell me you
don't feel the same.</font>

375
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,560
<font size="36">Well, my breast tenderness has gone.</font>

376
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,520
<font size="36">No! What am I talking about?</font>

377
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,440
<font size="36">I'm a man! We're men!

381
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,840
<font size="36">Oh, Beaches! No, Dirty Dancing!</font>

382
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,880
<font size="36">Oh, I can't decide!</font>

383
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:08,400
<font size="36">Dear God! I don't know
which one to watch either!</font>

384
