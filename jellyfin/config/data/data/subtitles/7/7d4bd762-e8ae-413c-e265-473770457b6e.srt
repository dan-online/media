just a few more...</font>

6
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,400
<font size="36">No, no, I'm sorry,
you've done more than enough.</font>

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,240
<font size="36">OK, all right, baby, see you later.
Bye-bye. Wow! Right?</font>

<font size="36">That's an impressive knowledge
of the Marvel universe. I know.</font>

don't say things like that.</font>

30
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,400
<font size="36">It went viral at 10:30, Roy,
of course I've seen it.</font>

the second episode</font>

00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,240
<font size="36">of my board games review show.</font>

35
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,800
<font size="36">Care to have a look?</font>

36
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,160
<font size="36">That was fast.</font>

37
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,520
<font size="36">Seems like only yesterday
we had to sit through the last one.</font>

38
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,280
<font size="36">It was three months ago, Jen.
Really?</font>

39
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,800
<font size="36">It feels like it just happened.
Roy, did you hear that?</font>

40
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,120
<font size="36">Moss has done his board game review
show again. I'm not watching that.</font>

41
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,760
<font size="36">I'm not watching that again.</font>

42
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,960
<font size="36">Jesus Christ,
we don't have to watch it, do we?</font>

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,600
<font size="36">We only sat through the first one
the other day.</font>

44
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:26,600
<font size="36">It was three months ago. My God!
Wow, it feels like it just ended.</font>

45
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,920
<font size="36">It was so boring! It was like being
insane, it was so insanely boring!</font>

00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,160
<font size="36">Roy's not a fan
but you said you liked it.</font>

47
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,840
<font size="36">Where did you get your coffee?
A new place. Any good? Really good.</font>

48
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,400
<font size="36">You specifically said, and I quote,</font>

49
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,280
<font size="36">"You must show me the next one,
Moss." Did I?</font>

He's cock-a-hoop over this Sheila.</font>

54
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,920
<font size="36">OK, so that'll be over soon, then.</font>

55
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,320
<font size="36">Hey, I'll have you know
that Alice is nuts about me.</font>

56
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:12,000
<font size="36">She thinks that I'm emotionally
artistic. Well, what does that mean?</font>

57
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,120
<font size="36">Erm, she said that emotionally
I was on the artistic spectrum.</font>

58
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,920
<font size="36">I think it means that I'm creative
about my feelings, you know,</font>

59
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,440
<font size="36">more in tune with her wants
and needs than most men.</font>

60
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,200
<font size="36">Oh, she's rung out...
That keeps happening.</font>

61
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,920
<font size="36">All right, if I'd said I'd watch it,</font>

62
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,600
<font size="36">then I suppose that's what
I'm going to have to do.</font>

63
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,800
<font size="36">That's the spirit, Jen.
Come on, let's get it over with.</font>

64
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,160
<font size="36">Now, keep an open mind.</font>

65
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,240
<font size="36">I know the first show was a bit
"bare boned" but I think you'll</font>

66
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,120
<font size="36">really enjoy my new episode,
or "webisode", if you prefer.</font>

67
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,000
<font size="36">I don't prefer that, no-one does.</font>

I've been playing Ports of Essen.</font>

88
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,920
<font size="36">Shouldn't we do rules
before components?</font>

89
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,760
<font size="36">It won't make any sense

it's so slow.</font>

101
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,440
<font size="36">OK, good, it is a bit slow,
we can work on that.</font>

102
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,240
<font size="36">And I guess the other thing is that
it's terrible.</font>

103
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,920
<font size="36">It's slow and terrible.</font>

104
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,280
<font size="36">If a friend asked me to describe it,
I'd say it's a slow,</font>

105
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,280
<font size="36">terrible thing on the internet, that
I could only watch for a minute.</font>

00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,320
<font size="36">Is this helpful? Arr...pfft!</font>

107
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:16,960

could only watch it for a minute.</font>

stuck into there.</font>

help you with anything else.</font>

110
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,760
<font size="36">Erm, none of you are any good
in front of a camera.</font>

111
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,520
<font size="36">None of us, yeah...
You've got really annoying voices.</font>

112
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,040
<font size="36">The voices are a pain, yes.</font>

113
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,160
<font size="36">I guess that's because
you haven't got any confidence.</font>

114
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:35,000
<font size="36">No confidence. I mean, if there's
one thing you need, it's confidence.</font>

115
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,480
<font size="36">It is confidence. Absolutely.</font>

116
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,360
<font size="36">Well, Jen, I can only thank you,
once again... And another thing...</font>

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
<font size="36">I'm not listening any more!</font>

118
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,000
<font size="36">Douglas, you're incorrigible.
I'm incorrigible?</font>

123
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,880
<font size="36">Perfumed porno vampire, I like that.</font>

124
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,880
<font size="36">So you're thinking of having 500 of
these travelling across London?</font>

125
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,080
<font size="36">That's what I said. Sexy and classy.</font>

126
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,240
<font size="36">And that's difficult to pull off.</font>

127
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,560
<font size="36">This will get people talking,
all right.</font>

128
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,960
<font size="36">Consider me one happy shareholder.</font>

129
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,520
<font size="36">Right. Oh, big party coming up on
Thursday night, if you're up for it?</font>

Secret Millionaire.</font>

131
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,920
<font size="36">BLEEP it, I'll cancel.
I'll tell my assistant.</font>

132
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,120
<font size="36">Hi, Joan. Jen. I'm not your
assistant, Mr Reynholm.</font>

133
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,360
<font size="36">I want you to cancel
Secret Millionaire for me.</font>

134
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,640
<font size="36">I'm not your assistant,
wouldn't know who to call.</font>

135
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,400
<font size="36">Just say anything, work your
usual magic. 'Not your assistant.</font>

136
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,960
<font size="36">'I am not your...'</font>

137
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,680
<font size="36">Oh, I'm sorry, I thought
this was the toilet.</font>

138
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,160
<font size="36">Didn't this used to be toilets?</font>

139
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,800
<font size="36">Yes, I moved my office here to be
closer to the ladies toilets.</font>

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,360
<font size="36">Must get someone to take
that sign down.</font>

141
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,320
<font size="36">What's wrong with you, Ross?</font>

142
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,720
<font size="36">Small mocha, please.
Small mocha, please. Okey-dokey.</font>

143
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,920
<font size="36">Or medium...</font>

144
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,240
<font size="36">Yeah, you know what? I've changed
my mind, I think I'll have a medium.</font>

145
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,360
<font size="36">So, you don't want a small one?</font>

146
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,200
<font size="36">Small's fine, small is just as good,
so I'll...just...</font>

147
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,920
<font size="36">Yes, that is what I'll have, I'll
have a small mocha, my little man.</font>

148
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,200
<font size="36">My good man.</font>

149
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,480
<font size="36">OK, coming up.</font>

150
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,480
<font size="36">Got it?</font>

151
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,520
<font size="36">OK.</font>

152
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,200
<font size="36">(Fuck's sake.)</font>

153
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,960
<font size="36">Thank you for the virgin
gin and tonic.</font>

154
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,320
<font size="36">I suppose you could just
call it tonic. Yes.</font>

155
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,640
<font size="36">So, Ross, how goes it
in the world of computers?</font>

156
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,240
<font size="36">Or PC world, if you will?</font>

157
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,320
<font size="36">We're all very happy,
thank you, Mr Reynholm.</font>

158
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,440
<font size="36">Very happy indeed. Forget this "we"
malarky, I'm talking to you, Ross.</font>

159
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,840
<font size="36">Are you happy? Very happy,
thank you, Mr Reynholm.</font>

160
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,400
<font size="36">Look, I'm not your boss.</font>

161
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,440
<font size="36">We're just a couple of guys,
a couple of guys,</font>

162
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,800
<font size="36">shooting the shit,
now tell me the truth.</font>

163
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,360
<font size="36">Well, I suppose, sometimes I do
feel I lack a little confidence.</font>

164
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,720
<font size="36">I know, it's silly.</font>

165
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,560
<font size="36">No, I've just realised what
a funny voice you have.</font>

166
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,800
<font size="36">Now, Ross, I'm going to
tell you something.</font>

167
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,440
<font size="36">Confidence is a confidence trick.
Look at me, what do you see?</font>

168
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,080
<font size="36">A man who inherited his father's
successful business.</font>

169
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,720
<font size="36">Wasn't that successful.
It was pretty successful.</font>

170
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,960
<font size="36">A lot more successful than it is
now, that's for sure.</font>

171
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,440
<font size="36">All right, all right,
just say the right thing.</font>

172
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,120
<font size="36">Say the thing I want you to say.</font>

173
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,880
<font size="36">Say, "A confident man", say "A
confident man". A confident man.</font>

174
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:18,040
<font size="36">I wasn't always this way. There was
a time when I was just like you.</font>

175
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,840
<font size="36">But then I discovered the secret.</font>

176
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,200
<font size="36">And, Ross, I'm going to tell you
what that secret is</font>

177
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,200
<font size="36">but you must keep it to yourself.</font>

178
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,520
<font size="36">I will take my ears to the grave.</font>

179
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,400
<font size="36">Two words. Women's slacks.</font>

180
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,040
<font size="36">I'm sorry?</font>

181
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,640
<font size="36">Women's slacks.</font>

182
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,760
<font size="36">Women's slacks? Yes.
I'm wearing women's slacks.</font>

183
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,760
<font size="36">You're wearing women's slacks? Yes.</font>

184
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,600
<font size="36">That's nothing like what I thought
you were going to say. Is it not?</font>

185
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,200
<font size="36">It is not.</font>

186
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,320
<font size="36">I thought you were going to give me
a book recommendation, or something.</font>

187
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,600
<font size="36">HE LAUGHS</font>

188
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,040
<font size="36">Book recommendation? I can't read.</font>

189
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,760
<font size="36">No, I don't know what it is,
but women's slacks give me</font>

190
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,160
<font size="36">the confidence I need to survive
in a tough business world.</font>

191
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,520
<font size="36">They're lighter, airier and less
constricted than men's trousers</font>

192
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,720
<font size="36">and I'm pretty sure
it doesn't make me a transvestite.</font>

193
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,160
<font size="36">Look at that shit, look at it.
I can't... How am I supposed to...</font>

194
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,440
<font size="36">It looks like he milked a cow over
it. You're so fussy about coffee.</font>

195
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,240
<font size="36">It's very annoying. It's ruined.
He ruined my coffee.</font>

196
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,080
<font size="36">Don't just chuck it like that.</font>

197
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,880
<font size="36">That fellow shouldn't be allowed to
be a barista. Why not?</font>

198
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,200
<font size="36">Because he's too small, Jen. He's
clearly too small to be a barista.</font>

199
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,360
<font size="36">What? You're being a bit of
a small person racist, Roy.</font>

200
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,600
<font size="36">A small person racist?
That's not a thing.</font>

201
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,720
<font size="36">You can't have tiny baristas, Jen.</font>

202
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,440
<font size="36">For God's sake,
the man works with steam.</font>

203
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,960
<font size="36">I'm going
to have to have a word with him.</font>

204
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,480
<font size="36">Have a word with him?
That's right. About his height?</font>

205
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,040
<font size="36">I think he'd appreciate
the feedback. About his height?</font>

206
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,480
<font size="36">That's not what people do, Roy.</font>

207
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,200
<font size="36">Well, I'm not people, Jen,
and I think that's a good thing.</font>

208
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,480
<font size="36">I'm not afraid to cut through
the bullshit.</font>

209
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:39,480
<font size="36">I bet this is exactly what Alice
was talking about. Autistic.</font>

210
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,200
<font size="36">She said, "Autistic."
That's what happened.</font>

211
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,920
<font size="36">No, I don't think so. There is no
artistic spectrum.</font>

212
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,280
<font size="36">But she's so...</font>

213
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,760
<font size="36">Did she say it during an argument,
by any chance?</font>

214
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,720
<font size="36">She did say it during a...
She did say it...</font>

215
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,240
<font size="36">You know what was weird, was
we were having quite a big argument</font>

216
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:05,080
<font size="36">and then suddenly, out of nowhere,
she paid me that lovely compliment.</font>

217
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,360
<font size="36">PHONE RINGS</font>

218
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,600
<font size="36">Hey, baby.</font>

219
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,440
<font size="36">Oh, oh, good, good, yes.</font>

220
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,320
<font size="36">Sure, yeah, I'd love to.</font>

221
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,040
<font size="36">Yes, OK, well I'll see you there.</font>

222
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,600
<font size="36">What? Why? No.</font>

223
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,920
<font size="36">Hello? Alice?</font>

224
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,840
<font size="36">That was weird. What? OK,
so, what the hell is that?</font>

225
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,720
<font size="36">So she tells me that her grandfather
died, she wants me to go to the</font>

226
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,840
<font size="36">funeral. I say that I'd be
delighted, then she hangs up on me.</font>

227
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,120
<font size="36">Her grandfather's funeral? Yeah.</font>

228
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,960
<font size="36">That's what you were just talking
about just there. That's right.</font>

229
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,080
<font size="36">You sounded like you were being
invited to Glastonbury.</font>

230
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:58,280
<font size="36">Oh, funerals are sad. You did not
sound sad.</font>

231
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,600
<font size="36">I wasn't concentrating.</font>

232
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,200
<font size="36">Emotionally artistic? You're
emotionally colour-blind,</font>

233
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,720
<font size="36">that's what you are.
Maybe I am emotional colour-blind.</font>

234
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,080
<font size="36">I was about to confront that
little man. I know.</font>

235
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,160
<font size="36">I was going to give him shit about
his height.</font>

236
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,960
<font size="36">Glad you realise now how
inappropriate that would've been.</font>

237
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,480
<font size="36">I'll just leave him a note.</font>

238
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:42,560
<font size="36">I'm here on purpose. Oh, yes.</font>

239
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,840
<font size="36">I'm interested in women's slacks.
I see.</font>

240
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,080
<font size="36">I'd like... Sorry. Hot ear.</font>

241
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:59,520
<font size="36">I'd like to buy a pair
of women's slacks.</font>

242
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:02,400
<font size="36">For me, not for a woman.</font>

243
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,720
<font size="36">Oh, yes,
well, that shouldn't be a problem.</font>

244
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,840
<font size="36">I'm not trying to look like a woman.
I understand.</font>

245
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,480
<font size="36">I'm not a confident man.</font>

246
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,920
<font size="36">Quite. Well, let's see what we can
do for you.</font>

247
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,920
<font size="36">I don't know about this.
Oh, just ask them, Jen.</font>

248
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,640
<font size="36">Me and Juan, we have a thing.</font>

249
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,480
<font size="36">I don't want another splashy-splashy
coffee from the teeny-tiny</font>

250
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,040
<font size="36">coffee man. Poor woman.</font>

251
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:37,360
<font size="36">No, no, no, don't give her money.
You're not supposed to do that.</font>

252
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,520
<font size="36">I'm actually a person,
Roy, with human feelings.</font>

253
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,440
<font size="36">SHE GIBBERS</font>

254
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,640
<font size="36">I'm sorry, I thought you were...</font>

255
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,520
<font size="36">SHE GIBBERS</font>

256
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,800
<font size="36">SHE GIBBERS</font>

257
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,600
<font size="36">I don't know if you want money. I'm
sorry, I'm sorry.</font>

258
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:05,200
<font size="36">I'm sorry, I'm sorry. What happened?
Never mind, just go.</font>

259
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,360
<font size="36">SHE GIBBERS</font>

260
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:21,440
<font size="36">What do you think? I think...</font>

261
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,520
<font size="36">you just sold a brother some slacks.</font>

262
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,520
<font size="36">Help, help, get off me!
Let go. You're a bully.</font>

263
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,480
<font size="36">Need to save that old woman,
but I have no confidence.</font>

264
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,280
<font size="36">Hey!</font>

265
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,120
<font size="36">Thank you.</font>

266
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,000
<font size="36">Hey, come, come, no queue for you.
Come on.</font>

267
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,720
<font size="36">Hello, Juan. I'm with her.</font>

268
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:30,640
<font size="36">It must be my birthday. I get to see
you twice so quick. Back again.</font>

269
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,520
<font size="36">Same as usual, please.</font>

270
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,720
<font size="36">Could I ask you a huge favour</font>

271
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,280
<font size="36">and ask you to make Roy's
coffee for him, too?</font>

272
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,440
<font size="36">I've been going on and on about you.
And I like what I heard.</font>

273
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,560
<font size="36">Would that be OK?
Would you mind?</font>

274
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,760
<font size="36">Of course, anything for you, my
sweet. OK.</font>

275
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,840
<font size="36">Slippery fingers.</font>

276
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,480
<font size="36">It's all right. It's not all right.
Look, it looks like me with a beard.</font>

I don't hate you.</font>

people, OK? I don't.</font>

286
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,520

You're bad at making coffee.</font>

small to make good coffee.</font>

00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,640
<font size="36">It's being called
the viral video of the year.</font>

onto a tramp</font>

with a small barista.</font>

294
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,760
<font size="36">You're just too small.</font>

295

and is hit by a van with breasts.</font>

How did you find out it was us?</font>

302
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,640
<font size="36">It's all here in the weekly

303
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,840
<font size="36">What's going on, Joan?
I expect better from my assistant.</font>

304
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,920
<font size="36">I'm not your assistant.
My name isn't Joan.</font>

305
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,680
<font size="36">What's your beef with the homeless?
I don't have any homeless beef.</font>

306
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:23,040
<font size="36">Ah, so it's women you hate.
Well, that I can understand.</font>

307
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:26,440
<font size="36">Whoa, whoa, you record our
e-mails and tape our phone calls?</font>

308
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,680
<font size="36">All right, dry your eyes, Bono.</font>

309

you've nothing to fear.</font>

310
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,680
<font size="36">It wasn't my fault Mr Reynholm.
I would never throw coffee over</font>

<font size="36">a homeless woman.</font>

312
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,600
<font size="36">I would never abuse a small person,</font>

I sort of did my one, too.</font>

315
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,120
<font size="36">It's frustrating that we did
both of our things. Yes, it is.</font>

316
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,160
<font size="36">All right, spare me.</font>

317
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,440
<font size="36">I was young once, but if this gets
out, this could deeply damage</font>

to do, Mr Reynholm?</font>

320
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,160
<font size="36">Don't do anything. Stay
out of trouble and remain there.</font>

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,960
<font size="36">There are places lower than
the basement.</font>

322
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,880
<font size="36">Stop worrying, Jen. Nobody can
make us out in that video.</font>

323
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,600
<font size="36">It's just like early footage of
happy slapping. Just relax.</font>

324
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,400
<font size="36">I can't relax. It's all
right for you. I have plans.</font>

325
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,160
<font size="36">I want to get up there. I will not
be a social piranha. A what, now?</font>

326
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,000
<font size="36">Jim, take a look at this. What is it?
It's the new-look game board.</font>

327
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:40,840
<font size="36">200,000 views?
I know. It's a bit different.</font>

328
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,440
<font size="36">Check it out. Game board.
Shut the fridge. It's...</font>

329
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,080
<font size="36">Game board.
BLEEP game board.</font>

330
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,400
<font size="36">Say what?</font>

331
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,440
<font size="36">Wow!
You all seem different somehow. Yes.</font>

332
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,560
<font size="36">We're all wearing women's trousers.</font>

333
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,440
<font size="36">Oh. Right.</font>

334
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,920
<font size="36">Hey, what's going on? Let's get the
game board.</font>

335
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,240
<font size="36">He is... Newton Sinclair.</font>

336
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,520
<font size="36">This guy is... Roger Booth.</font>

337
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,560
<font size="36">And I guess I'm still Maurice Moss.</font>

338
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,120
<font size="36">Are you wearing your trousers now?</font>

339
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,840
<font size="36">I couldn't wear them all the time,
Jen - I'd have a heart attack.</font>

340
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,080
<font size="36">No, they're safely locked
away in my fortress of solitude.</font>

341
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,240
<font size="36">It's funny - when I wear them,
I'm a dynamo.</font>

342
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,120
<font size="36">A young Leonard Kravitz,
people hanging off my every word.</font>

343
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,640
<font size="36">And then as soon as I take them off,
I'm just back to being the same...</font>

344
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:44,520
<font size="36">She's gone, hasn't she? She's gone.
She went quite a while ago. Yeah.</font>

345
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:48,520
<font size="36">Oh, Michael Buble's here.
No, no, it's a funeral, Moss.</font>

346
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,560
<font size="36">I have to go to this
funeral for Alice's grandfather</font>

347
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,280
<font size="36">and I'm not looking forward to it.</font>

348
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,160
<font size="36">Funerals are pain in the crack.</font>

349
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,480
<font size="36">Even in the best of circumstances,
they're no picnic,</font>

350
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,560
<font size="36">but now I've got Alice on my arse,
like the emotion police.</font>

351
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,920
<font size="36">I'm going to have to look
convincingly sad</font>

352
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,160
<font size="36">for the majority of the day.</font>

353
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,760
<font size="36">She's not going to expect me to cry,
is she? No. What if she does?</font>

354
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,120
<font size="36">I can't cry on cue. What do I do
then?</font>

355
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,520
<font size="36">Do what I do when I need to cry.
Use a mild pepper-spray solution.</font>

356
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,040
<font size="36">Now that makes sense. See?</font>

357
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,800
<font size="36">That makes more sense than
having to feel something.</font>

358
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,560
<font size="36">Do you have any of that stuff here?</font>

359
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,160
<font size="36">Why do you think
we have a mini-fridge?</font>

360
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,840
<font size="36">Good evening.</font>

361
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,640
<font size="36">You've got quite a lot of it.</font>

362
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,800
<font size="36">I suppose I have made
quite a lot of it.</font>

363
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:46,160
<font size="36">And what's in here? Just Tabasco,
wasabi and a bit of tear gas.</font>

364
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,800
<font size="36">Those sound like bad things to put
in your eyes. It's extremely mild.</font>

365
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,440
<font size="36">It's mainly water. OK, I'll take it
as a last resort. As a last resort?</font>

366
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,240
<font size="36">In case I find myself out
of my emotional death. There you go.</font>

367
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,560
<font size="36">All right. Thanks, Moss.
Bye. Bye.</font>

368
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,160

<font size="36">Richmond, do you work here or not?</font>

559
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,960
<font size="36">I don't get paid,
but I like to come in.</font>

560
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,080
<font size="36">So that Goth to boss thing didn't
work out?</font>

561
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,600
<font size="36">Does it look like it worked out?</font>

562
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,240
<font size="36">Anyway, how have you guys been?</font>

563
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,520
<font size="36">Everyone thinks I'm a misogynist.</font>

564
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,480
<font size="36">Roy lost his girlfriend because
he's emotionally colour-blind</font>

565
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,800
<font size="36">and Moss is wearing trousers
that make him good at telly.</font>

566
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,680
<font size="36">Any gossip?</font>

567
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,960
<font size="36">What's going on with you?</font>

568
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,960
<font size="36">Oh, you know, keeping busy,
voice-over work mainly.</font>

569
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,880
<font size="36">Really, how did that happen?</font>

570
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,520
<font size="36">Someone just noticed
I had a beautiful voice.</font>

571
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,840
<font size="36">Oh, Richmond.</font>

572
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,520
<font size="36">Things aren't going well at all.</font>

573
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,800
<font size="36">Just get in there.</font>

574
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,200
<font size="36">It's just not the same
when you guys aren't together.</font>

575
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,480
<font size="36">Anyway, if you want me,
you know where I am.</font>

576
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,640
<font size="36">I don't, though, Richmond.</font>

577
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,680
<font size="36">Don't...lurk!</font>

578
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,640
<font size="36">Where did he go?</font>

579
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,200
<font size="36">Where did who go?</font>

580
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,640
<font size="36">Does it ever seem to you that
the things that happen to us</font>

581
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,680
<font size="36">are sort of...</font>

582
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,360
<font size="36">strange?</font>

583
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,480
<font size="36">How so, Roy?</font>

584
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,680
<font size="36">Well...</font>

585
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,480
<font size="36">remember when I had to pretend
to be disabled</font>

586
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,560
<font size="36">and I ended up in Manchester?</font>

587
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,360
<font size="36">That wasn't a normal thing
to happen, was it?</font>

588
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:58,920
<font size="36">Or when you ended up spending
the night in that arcade machine.</font>

589
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,680
<font size="36">That was odd.</font>

590
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,360
<font size="36">I suppose those were unusual events.</font>

591
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,920
<font size="36">And this is strange.</font>

592
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,920
<font size="36">What's happening to us
right now is strange, isn't it?</font>

593
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,280
<font size="36">Well, at least,
it'll all be over soon.</font>

594
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,400
<font size="36">Douglas is bound to fire us
when he gets back.</font>

595
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,080
<font size="36">Come on, guys, this isn't us.</font>

596
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,080
<font size="36">Are we just going to sit here
and take it?</font>

597
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,440
<font size="36">What do we normally do
when we get into a scrape?</font>

598
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,840
<font size="36">We normally make things worse
and worse and then it ends.</font>

599
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,520
<font size="36">No, we don't. We stick together.
That doesn't sound like us.</font>

600
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,360
<font size="36">Don't know where you're getting that
from... Come on, who are we?</font>

601
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,320
<font size="36">Who are we? I want to hear
you say it!</font>

602
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,080
<font size="36">We're the IT... We're the IT...
..Department.</font>

603
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,960
<font size="36">You're goddamn right we are!</font>

604
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,360
<font size="36">Are you wearing women's slacks?
Yes, I am.</font>

605
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,240
<font size="36">This is exactly what
I'm talking about.</font>

606
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,040
<font size="36">Let's get into a car
and cruise around.</font>

607
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:01,960
<font size="36">How to get into a car?
Smash a window. Great idea.</font>

608
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,360
<font size="36">That's the one.</font>

609
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,480
<font size="36">I'm such an idiot.
I've got a robot hand.</font>

610
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,080
<font size="36">Hang on a second. This is MY car.</font>

611

00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,480
<font size="36">Oh, shit. Wow-wow-wow.
It's all right, everyone, be cool.</font>

616
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,560
<font size="36">I'll handle this. Take that.</font>

617

<font size="36">It's all right, Officer, I'm doing
Secret Millionaire.</font>

618
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,000
<font size="36">Come on, come on, come on, people.
What's going on?</font>

619
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,680
<font size="36">Come on, come on, come on, people.</font>

620
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,680
<font size="36">How long has he been wearing the
trousers? He won't take them off.</font>

621
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,080
<font size="36">OK, come on, come on, come on...</font>

622
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,920
<font size="36">What's going on, what's going on?
We don't know what's happening.</font>

623
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,200
<font size="36">OK, come on. To every problem,
there's a solution.</font>

624
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,240
<font size="36">What's our problem here?
What's our problem?</font>

625
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:22,560
<font size="36">Everyone thinks I'm a cow who
hates women. You're a cow.</font>

626
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,800
<font size="36">Terrible cow. Women, OK.
Roy, hurt me.</font>

627
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,560
<font size="36">Erm, the woman I love thinks that
I hate small people.</font>

628
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,960
<font size="36">Small people, thank you, Roy.</font>

629
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,160
<font size="36">I'm probably going to die alone
in front of computer pornography?</font>

630
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,920
<font size="36">I'll just draw a sad face.</font>

631
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:49,960
<font size="36">OK, so what do women and
small people both like?</font>

632
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,960
<font size="36">What do they both like? Chairs.
Films. I really don't know.</font>

633
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,480
<font size="36">I'll tell you. It's just they seem
like very different groups.</font>

634
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,760
<font size="36">Very different groups.
Not being attacked.</font>

635
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,640
<font size="36">They both love not being attacked.</font>

636
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,920
<font size="36">Well, I can't speak for small people,
obviously, but as a woman,</font>

637
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,680
<font size="36">I certainly like not being attacked.
Where are you going with this, Moss?</font>

638
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:21,000
<font size="36">I'll tell you exactly where I'm
going with this, Roy.</font>

639
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,040
<font size="36">I'm saying that we use this brief
window, while Douglas is away,</font>

640
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,880
<font size="36">to produce a pepper-spray
solution for small women,</font>

641
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,040
<font size="36">using that stuff I gave Roy earlier.</font>

642
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,560
<font size="36">That sounds really weird.</font>

643
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,960
<font size="36">Jen Barber, not a hater of women
but their defender, their champion.</font>

644
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,160
<font size="36">I love it now.</font>

645
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,840
<font size="36">And I can do a massive presentation.</font>

646
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,280
<font size="36">A self-defence pepper spray for
small women suits my purposes also.</font>

647
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,880
<font size="36">It will show Alice that I care and,
as a woman with small relatives,</font>

648
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,560
<font size="36">she's sure to come to Jen's
presentation.</font>

649
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,920
<font size="36">You know, when I first stocked
that mini-fridge
with pepper-spray solution,</font>

650
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:02,200
<font size="36">I thought I'd made too much...but
only now do I realise</font>

651
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,000
<font size="36">that I'd made exactly the right
amount for our current purposes.</font>

652
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:11,560
<font size="36">It almost seems like it's
too good an idea.</font>

653
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,600
<font size="36">You see what we can do when we work
together? With my business acumen...</font>

654
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,440
<font size="36">My scientific know-how...
And I'm also here...</font>

655
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,760
<font size="36">We can do anything! Yes! Yes!</font>

656
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,160
<font size="36">I need a trouser break.</font>

657
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,000
<font size="36">You coming, Roy?</font>

658
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,640
<font size="36">I can't seem to get the wording
of this speech to Alice right.</font>

659
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,040
<font size="36">You're doing a speech?</font>

660
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:45,120
<font size="36">Yeah, I need to show her that I'm
not emotionally colour-blind.</font>

661
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:49,200
<font size="36">I'm actually a very sensitive human
man, and she needs to know that.</font>

662
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:53,640
<font size="36">Oooh, what's a more romantic word
for "knockers"?</font>

663
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,240
<font size="36">A MORE romantic word?</font>

664
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,200
<font size="36">Come on, guys. Let's protect women!
I'll meet you up there. Good luck.</font>

665
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,440
<font size="36">Thanks.</font>

666
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,680
<font size="36">Eartha Kitts!</font>

667
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:07,800
<font size="36">Right, is everything ready?</font>

668
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,400
<font size="36">Yeah, well, I've got the posters up</font>

669
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,280
<font size="36">and I've put gift bags with pepper
spray beside each chair.</font>

670
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,920
<font size="36">Now, I think it was a master stroke
to put the spray in these</font>

671
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,280
<font size="36">elegant bottles.</font>

672
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,240
<font size="36">Why not look stylish
while you defend yourself?</font>

673
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,280
<font size="36">Something's bothering me, though.</font>

674
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:25,040
<font size="36">Are we missing something that's very
obviously wrong with this idea?</font>

675
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,080
<font size="36">I really don't think so. Oh, look,
here comes everyone.</font>

676
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,760
<font size="36">Hello, and welcome to this
very special</font>

677
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:40,560
<font size="36">presentation for women by a woman, me
a woman, who loves women.</font>

678
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:44,280
<font size="36">By your seats you'll find a gift bag,
and in that gift bag</font>

679
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,720
<font size="36">you'll find our very
exciting new product.</font>

680
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,080
<font size="36">No, don't do that.</font>

681
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,920
<font size="36">SCREAMING</font>

682
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,840
<font size="36">No, you're not supposed to...</font>

683
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,080
<font size="36">Yes! I have some things
I have to say to you!</font>

684
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:01,480
<font size="36">No, I need to go.
No, you are going nowhere.</font>

685
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,480
<font size="36">Now, I know in the past that you
have accused me</font>

686
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,760
<font size="36">of being emotionally colour-blind.</font>

687
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:08,920
<font size="36">SHE SCREAMS</font>

688
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,920
<font size="36">Shut up and listen. But now I've
changed - my sight is perfect.</font>

689
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,040
<font size="36">Now I know what was wrong
with the idea.</font>

690
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:20,960
<font size="36">With your sweet lips and, of
course, your lovely bangers,</font>

691
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,160
<font size="36">I know you're the one for me.</font>

692
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,680
<font size="36">I'm in terrible pain.</font>

693
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:30,400
<font size="36">Me, too, Alice, me, too, but that
ends now. It ends now.</font>

694
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:40,000
<font size="36">That could not have gone better.</font>

695
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:43,360
<font size="36">Oh, no, Roy, that didn't go
well at all.</font>

696
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,160
<font size="36">Oh, right, because we're going to

the can of lager,</font>

700
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,840

corrupting a minor.</font>

I bought the tramp uniform</font>

Yeah, somewhere off-piste.</font>

care of business upstairs.</font>
