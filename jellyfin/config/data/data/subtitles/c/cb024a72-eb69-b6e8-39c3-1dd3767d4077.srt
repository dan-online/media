1
00:01:20,422 --> 00:01:21,891
Uh...

2
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:37,840
Oh, I have to finish
all this before...

3
00:01:39,708 --> 00:01:41,977
Go and steam
the tablecloths for tonight.

4
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:44,380
I'm going to paint over that
water stain in the ceiling.

5
00:01:47,115 --> 00:01:48,184
Huh!

6
00:01:54,022 --> 00:01:56,826
Huh? Oh.

7
00:01:59,561 --> 00:02:00,796
Like, this afternoon?

8
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,564
- Five minutes!
- What?

9
00:02:07,302 --> 00:02:09,639
Which paint did you use?

10
00:02:50,612 --> 00:02:53,216
Joy is here? Go set the table.
He must be hungry.

11
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,654
We talk later?

12
00:03:25,981 --> 00:03:27,683
Hey, hey!

13
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:30,820
Thank you for doing this.

14
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,422
You look really pretty
right now.

15
00:03:33,455 --> 00:03:35,257
Oh, you like this...

16
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,126
this hot Mormon look?

17
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,462
I'm just telling you now
in case my mom says

18
00:03:40,495 --> 00:03:44,133
something dumb
like you're fat or whatever.

19
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,534
I thought you said when she says

20
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:47,303
shit like that,
it means she cares.

21
00:03:49,071 --> 00:03:50,139
Hi, Evelyn.

22
00:03:50,172 --> 00:03:51,473
- Mrs Wang!
- Hey, Mom.

23
00:03:51,506 --> 00:03:53,676
I only cook enough food
for three people.

24
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:55,611
Now I have to cook more.

25
00:03:59,181 --> 00:04:01,217
It's Joy. She brought Becky.

26
00:04:10,225 --> 00:04:12,428
- Hi!
- Hi, honey!

27
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:14,563
Hi, Mr Wang!

28
00:04:14,596 --> 00:04:17,399
Hi, Becky! Thank you for coming.

29
00:04:17,432 --> 00:04:19,768
Please call me Waymond.
Here, sit.

30
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,638
You know,
he doesn't have to stay.

31
00:04:22,671 --> 00:04:23,972
Who's he?

32
00:04:24,005 --> 00:04:25,441
- Becky.
- Becky's a she.

33
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,142
You know me.

34
00:04:27,175 --> 00:04:28,711
I always mix up 'he', 'she'.

35
00:04:28,744 --> 00:04:31,380
In Chinese,
just one word - 'ta' - so easy.

36
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:32,881
And the way you two are dressed,

37
00:04:32,914 --> 00:04:34,783
I'm sure I'm not the only one
calling him 'he'.

38
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,652
I mean her 'him'. Ugh!

39
00:04:36,685 --> 00:04:39,922
Anyways, my English is fine
and we have Google.

40
00:04:39,955 --> 00:04:42,057
So you don't have to come
and be a translator.

41
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,659
You stay here.

42
00:04:43,692 --> 00:04:44,927
And she can go.

43
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,729
Look, I honestly
think it's weird, OK?

44
00:04:46,762 --> 00:04:49,398
But Becky wants to help.
Right, Becky?

45
00:04:49,431 --> 00:04:52,434
I always learn something when
I hang out with the elderly.

46
00:04:52,467 --> 00:04:54,436
Old people are very wise.

47
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:55,871
Hmm. It's OK.

48
00:04:55,904 --> 00:04:57,906
We'll take Gong Gong
with us to the meeting.

49
00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:00,976
Uh, you and Becky stay here
and decorate. Hmm?

50
00:05:04,446 --> 00:05:06,348
Where is he?
When can I meet him?

51
00:05:08,617 --> 00:05:10,886
Huh! Customers.

52
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:12,388
Eat fast.

53
00:05:18,226 --> 00:05:19,595
- Mom.
- What?

54
00:05:19,628 --> 00:05:20,929
Mom, just wait.

55
00:05:20,962 --> 00:05:22,698
Wait? Wait?
No time to wait today.

56
00:05:22,731 --> 00:05:24,032
Just please...

57
00:05:24,065 --> 00:05:27,069
Joy, any other time,
I beg you to come and eat

58
00:05:27,102 --> 00:05:29,838
or call me or anything,
but today very busy.

59
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,549
Mom, this is literally
what it's always like.

60
00:05:31,573 --> 00:05:32,875
Wrong white paint!

61
00:05:32,908 --> 00:05:34,786
I know you haven't always
liked Becky, OK, but...

62
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,146
I like Becky. She is very nice.

63
00:05:37,179 --> 00:05:39,415
You are very lucky...

64
00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:46,288
She's half Mexican.

65
00:05:48,323 --> 00:05:49,692
Ugh!

66
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:53,195
- Huh!
- No shoes in washer.

67
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,963
Broken, you pay, yeah?

68
00:05:54,996 --> 00:05:58,500
But Gong Gong,
his heart cannot take it,

69
00:05:58,533 --> 00:05:59,935
especially after
such a long flight.

70
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:02,638
You want him to come all the way
from China to die like that?

71
00:06:02,671 --> 00:06:04,540
He's not gonna die.

72
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:05,641
Ooh!

73
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,777
- How can I help you?
- Just hold on. I can't hear you.

74
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,446
- Just hold on.
- How can I help you?

75
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:11,780
I'm here to pick up some shirts.

76
00:06:11,813 --> 00:06:13,558
- I called, like, three times.
- Give me your ticket.

77
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:14,692
- Mmm-hmm, yeah.
- I find for you.

78
00:06:14,716 --> 00:06:16,051
- No, I have the ticket.
- Babe...

79
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,695
She's just asking
for it 'cause that's, like,

80
00:06:17,719 --> 00:06:18,887
the way that it works.

81
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,189
They don't read minds.

82
00:06:20,222 --> 00:06:23,192
Then hang up! Thank you.

83
00:06:23,225 --> 00:06:24,960
We've been together
for three years.

84
00:06:24,993 --> 00:06:27,396
Don't you think Gong Gong
would want to know?

85
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:28,764
Let him enjoy his party tonight.

86
00:06:28,797 --> 00:06:30,732
Yeah, you think
Becky's gonna get through

87
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:32,310
the whole party without
introducing herself...

88
00:06:32,334 --> 00:06:34,403
- Evelyn!
- Have you met Becky?

89
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:37,740
Guess whose $20 got eaten
by the machine again.

90
00:06:38,673 --> 00:06:40,776
Waymond! Customers need you!

91
00:06:40,809 --> 00:06:42,177
Alright, coming!

92
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,813
Evelyn, you know,
my wife used to wear

93
00:06:44,846 --> 00:06:47,115
that exact same perfume,
God rest her soul.

94
00:06:47,148 --> 00:06:48,884
Are you coming
to the party tonight?

95
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:51,086
Yeah, I got my ticket
right here.

96
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:57,659
Sorry. It was too crowded here
so I moved some upstairs.

97
00:06:57,692 --> 00:06:59,495
I think the clothes
are happier there.

98
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:08,804
See? They're happier here.

99
00:07:14,776 --> 00:07:17,012
No more Google eyes!

100
00:07:17,045 --> 00:07:19,281
Mom, can we please
talk about Becky?

101
00:07:20,048 --> 00:07:21,826
I still don't know
what his brain is thinking.

102
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,052
Can Becky come tonight or not?

103
00:07:24,085 --> 00:07:25,621
- Stop changing the subject.
- I'm not.

104
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,256
You know, it's like our auditor.

105
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:29,024
She is a terrible person.

106
00:07:29,057 --> 00:07:32,061
She keeps targeting
the Chinese in the community.

107
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:35,497
You know, two years of meetings,

108
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,499
she puts a lien
on our laundromat.

109
00:07:37,532 --> 00:07:38,934
And you know
what your father does?

110
00:07:38,967 --> 00:07:40,802
He brings her cookies.

111
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:45,941
Every day I fight, I fight.

112
00:07:45,974 --> 00:07:47,976
I fight for all of us.

113
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:51,246
Every day is a battle here.

114
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,018
Oh, your father, he doesn't care
about the way things are...

115
00:07:59,054 --> 00:08:02,124
I try to make our lives
easier and more simple.

116
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,435
You should have told me earlier.

117
00:08:13,468 --> 00:08:15,070
That's really impressive.

118
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,872
Evelyn, you have
to see Rick dance.

119
00:08:16,905 --> 00:08:19,274
Look, he knows all of the moves.

120
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,744
Becky, I'll fucking kill myself.

121
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,081
He wants to be an actor,
just like you did.

122
00:08:30,151 --> 00:08:33,422
♪ Just put your hand

123
00:08:33,455 --> 00:08:35,057
♪ In my hand... ♪

124
00:08:36,658 --> 00:08:41,763
♪ And we'll spin
through eternity

125
00:08:41,796 --> 00:08:44,866
♪ Life can be so delicious

126
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,068
♪ Delicious... ♪

127
00:08:50,505 --> 00:08:54,276
Ah! I love this!

128
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:56,078
- Hey!
- Rick, you're so terrific.

129
00:08:56,978 --> 00:08:58,213
I know. I just...

130
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,124
I just don't know how to be
any fucking clearer.

131
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:01,216
It's like she can choose -

132
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,818
either you come
to the party with me

133
00:09:02,851 --> 00:09:04,252
and Gong Gong
is eternally ashamed

134
00:09:04,285 --> 00:09:06,054
until he forgets it all
and then he dies

135
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,457
or you don't come with me
and then he still dies.

136
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,426
What? Huh!

137
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,795
- What are you saying?
- That was a joke.

138
00:09:13,828 --> 00:09:16,932
Uh, that's not
a very funny joke, honey.

139
00:09:16,965 --> 00:09:18,400
- Hey, guys...
- This is only $10.

140
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,302
I thought you people
were very good with math.

141
00:09:20,335 --> 00:09:21,912
- Next time I give you interest.
- Evelyn?

142
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,071
Mom, Mom...

143
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,307
- Mom! Mom!
- What?!

144
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,509
Huh!

145
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,051
Waymond! Waymond!

146
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,523
Huh?

147
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,126
Oh!

148
00:09:45,226 --> 00:09:46,462
Uh...

149
00:09:50,231 --> 00:09:53,102
Uh...

150
00:09:56,204 --> 00:09:58,240
Uh...

151
00:10:03,578 --> 00:10:06,515
Shit, how do you say it? Uh...

152
00:10:07,782 --> 00:10:09,118
Oh!

153
00:10:12,253 --> 00:10:13,253
Mom...

154
00:10:14,956 --> 00:10:17,025
You know what?
I'm actually not doing that.

155
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,962
It's like
at this point I do not...

156
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,435
It was nice to meet you!

157
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:32,374
Hi! Give us five-star cleaning.

158
00:10:32,407 --> 00:10:33,875
Also...

159
00:10:33,908 --> 00:10:35,911
There is a Chinese
New Year party tonight,

160
00:10:35,944 --> 00:10:37,813
open to all the customers
in the community.

161
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:38,914
Thank you.

162
00:10:38,947 --> 00:10:40,682
- Please come and enjoy...
- This is fine.

163
00:10:40,715 --> 00:10:41,750
- The good food...
- OK.

164
00:10:41,783 --> 00:10:43,185
- And nice music, OK?
- Alright.

165
00:10:43,218 --> 00:10:45,187
I get you an invite.
Moment... moment, please.

166
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,589
- Can you hear this right now?
- Joy, wait! Please!

167
00:10:47,622 --> 00:10:49,291
I have something to say to you!

168
00:10:49,324 --> 00:10:50,993
What?

169
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,602
You...

170
00:11:01,469 --> 00:11:03,605
you have to try
and eat healthier.

171
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:06,709
You are getting fat.

172
00:11:56,157 --> 00:11:57,859
Evelyn?

173
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:01,697
Evelyn?

174
00:12:26,187 --> 00:12:27,856
Go, go, go, go!

175
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:29,124
OK!

176
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:13,702
If I have to think
of one more thing today,

177
00:13:13,735 --> 00:13:15,871
my head will explode.

178
00:13:29,284 --> 00:13:31,152
You may be in grave danger.

179
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,789
There's no time to explain.
Hold this.

180
00:13:36,124 --> 00:13:37,659
Why are you doing this?

181
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:38,760
Pay attention.

182
00:13:38,793 --> 00:13:41,263
When we leave this elevator,
you can either turn left

183
00:13:41,296 --> 00:13:42,640
towards your scheduled
audit appointment

184
00:13:42,664 --> 00:13:46,235
or you can turn right and go
into the janitor's closet.

185
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,337
Why would I go
into the janitor's...

186
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,572
Not now.

187
00:13:54,108 --> 00:13:56,578
Why you download
all these apps on my phone?

188
00:13:58,713 --> 00:13:59,748
Breathe in.

189
00:13:59,781 --> 00:14:01,884
You're gonna feel a slight
pressure in your head.

190
00:14:02,984 --> 00:14:04,686
Huh!

191
00:15:02,377 --> 00:15:04,212
Hey, baby Joy!

192
00:15:04,245 --> 00:15:06,114
You come back here!

193
00:15:06,147 --> 00:15:07,382
Shut up!

194
00:15:07,415 --> 00:15:09,250
You don't talk
to your mother like this!

195
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,220
I'll talk to her
how I fucking want!

196
00:15:16,057 --> 00:15:18,326
Activation...

197
00:15:21,262 --> 00:15:23,031
The moment you're
situated in your meeting,

198
00:15:23,064 --> 00:15:24,666
follow these instructions.

199
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:27,936
But, remember, no-one can know.

200
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,304
Don't even talk to me about this

201
00:15:29,337 --> 00:15:30,905
because I won't remember.

202
00:15:30,938 --> 00:15:32,607
- But I...
- Shh.

203
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,612
Mental scan complete.

204
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,322
Talk to you soon.

205
00:16:13,714 --> 00:16:15,350
Hello!

206
00:16:19,053 --> 00:16:21,289
Mrs Wang?

207
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:23,692
Mrs Wang?

208
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,695
Mrs Wang, are you with us?

209
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:29,631
Yes.

210
00:16:30,431 --> 00:16:31,900
Of course. I am here.

211
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:33,501
- Just thinking.
- Oh, OK.

212
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:36,538
Well, I was just hoping...

213
00:16:37,305 --> 00:16:39,641
that you could explain this.

214
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,314
This is a receipt.

215
00:16:47,348 --> 00:16:48,884
My receipt.

216
00:16:53,254 --> 00:16:54,489
Look, I...

217
00:16:54,522 --> 00:16:57,592
I was just hoping
you could enlighten me

218
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,762
as to how,
as a laundromat owner,

219
00:17:00,795 --> 00:17:02,630
a karaoke machine

220
00:17:02,663 --> 00:17:04,866
could constitute
a business expense?

221
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:06,734
I am a singer.

222
00:17:08,703 --> 00:17:10,705
- Of course you are.
- It's true.

223
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,007
She has a beautiful voice. Oh!

224
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,009
Evelyn, sing a song for her.

225
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:16,945
- Shh!
- No, no, please.

226
00:17:16,978 --> 00:17:18,513
That will not be necessary.

227
00:17:18,546 --> 00:17:21,449
But I will need
a separate Schedule C

228
00:17:21,482 --> 00:17:24,652
for each of these businesses

229
00:17:24,685 --> 00:17:27,555
because based on what
you're trying to deduct,

230
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:30,992
you're also a novelist
and a chef.

231
00:17:31,025 --> 00:17:32,894
Last time, you told me that...

232
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,896
Please.

233
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:36,264
A teacher,

234
00:17:36,297 --> 00:17:39,601
uh, and a singing coach

235
00:17:39,634 --> 00:17:42,303
and a 'Watsu' technician.

236
00:17:42,336 --> 00:17:45,574
I'm sorry.
What... what is 'Watsu'?

237
00:17:46,407 --> 00:17:48,143
It's a water massage.

238
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,879
What's a water massage?

239
00:17:50,912 --> 00:17:53,047
Like... like for back pain.

240
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,516
You go get a water massage.

241
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:56,117
- Oh, you go?
- Yes.

242
00:18:51,772 --> 00:18:53,208
What's happening?

243
00:18:53,241 --> 00:18:55,744
Like I'm talking
to my ex-husband.

244
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,581
Like I said to you before,
co-mingling of your...

245
00:18:59,614 --> 00:19:01,649
- It's you messing with my head.
- Shh!

246
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,685
- Don't shh me!
- You got to relax your body.

247
00:19:03,718 --> 00:19:05,620
Don't...

248
00:19:05,653 --> 00:19:06,654
Calm down, please!

249
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,489
Calm down.

250
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:11,092
Relax your body
in the other universe. Please.

251
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,561
These deductions...

252
00:19:13,594 --> 00:19:15,096
Go into auto-pilot.

253
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,932
You can't then
deduct it if it's an off...

254
00:19:17,965 --> 00:19:20,768
Good. Good.

255
00:19:20,801 --> 00:19:23,404
They don't know you and I
are in this universe yet

256
00:19:23,437 --> 00:19:25,506
so, hopefully, I'll have
some time to explain.

257
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,209
I am not your husband.
At least not the one you know.

258
00:19:28,242 --> 00:19:29,510
I am another version of him

259
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,379
from another life path,
another universe.

260
00:19:31,412 --> 00:19:34,216
I'm here because
we need your help.

261
00:19:35,249 --> 00:19:37,719
Very busy today.
No time to help you.

262
00:19:37,752 --> 00:19:38,887
Shh!

263
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,522
There is a great evil
that has taken root in my world

264
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,057
and has begun
spreading its chaos

265
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,167
throughout the many verses.

266
00:19:44,191 --> 00:19:45,793
I have spent years searching

267
00:19:45,826 --> 00:19:47,562
for the one who might
be able to match

268
00:19:47,595 --> 00:19:49,764
this great evil
with an even greater good

269
00:19:49,797 --> 00:19:51,299
and bring back balance.

270
00:19:51,332 --> 00:19:53,735
All those years of searching
have brought me here...

271
00:19:53,768 --> 00:19:56,070
- Mrs Wang?
- ..to this universe.

272
00:19:56,103 --> 00:19:57,004
- Hello?!
- To you.

273
00:19:57,038 --> 00:19:59,007
I know it's a lot
to take in right now...

274
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,008
Mrs Wang?!

275
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,610
Hello?

276
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,812
Look, I'm sure you have
a lot on your mind,

277
00:20:04,845 --> 00:20:08,916
but I cannot imagine
anything mattering more

278
00:20:08,949 --> 00:20:11,819
than the conversation
we are now having

279
00:20:11,852 --> 00:20:14,322
concerning your tax liability.

280
00:20:14,355 --> 00:20:16,324
Uh, need I remind you
that there is

281
00:20:16,357 --> 00:20:17,925
already a lien on your property?

282
00:20:17,958 --> 00:20:19,894
Repossession is well
within our rights.

283
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:23,098
I know. I am paying attention.

284
00:20:27,702 --> 00:20:29,638
Do you see these?

285
00:20:31,706 --> 00:20:33,908
You don't get one of these

286
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,044
unless you've seen
a lot of bullshit.

287
00:20:36,077 --> 00:20:37,646
Excuse my French.

288
00:20:38,412 --> 00:20:39,781
Now you may...

289
00:20:39,814 --> 00:20:42,950
only see a pile of
boring forms and numbers,

290
00:20:42,983 --> 00:20:44,853
but I see a story.

291
00:20:46,087 --> 00:20:49,123
With nothing
but a stack of receipts,

292
00:20:49,156 --> 00:20:53,128
I can trace the ups and downs
of your lives.

293
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,698
And it does not look good.

294
00:20:57,665 --> 00:21:01,669
It does not look good.

295
00:21:01,702 --> 00:21:04,038
- But...
- Uh...

296
00:21:04,071 --> 00:21:08,543
Sorry, my wife confuses
her hobbies for businesses.

297
00:21:08,576 --> 00:21:10,612
An honest mistake.

298
00:21:11,379 --> 00:21:13,615
Oh! OK.

299
00:21:14,382 --> 00:21:17,285
Well, with all of these, um...

300
00:21:18,552 --> 00:21:19,954
"honest mistakes,"

301
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:23,091
I mean, even if we don't
charge you with fraud,

302
00:21:23,124 --> 00:21:25,626
we'll most certainly
have to fine you

303
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,629
for gross negligence.

304
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,631
You're always
trying to confuse us

305
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,068
with these big words.

306
00:21:33,868 --> 00:21:36,471
I thought
you were going to bring

307
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:40,375
your daughter
to help you translate.

308
00:21:40,408 --> 00:21:42,710
- I am going to bring my...
- Hey!

309
00:21:42,743 --> 00:21:44,312
- Sorry.
- Evelyn?

310
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:45,446
She was going to come...

311
00:21:45,479 --> 00:21:47,248
Evelyn!
Are you paying attention?

312
00:21:47,281 --> 00:21:48,416
I cannot talk now.

313
00:21:48,449 --> 00:21:49,917
She's too busy
to help her parents?

314
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,552
Unless you can help me
with my taxes.

315
00:21:51,585 --> 00:21:53,888
What is "gross necklaces"?

316
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:55,990
I know you have a lot
of things on your mind,

317
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,759
but nothing could
possibly matter more

318
00:21:57,792 --> 00:21:59,394
than this conversation
we are having

319
00:21:59,427 --> 00:22:00,828
right now concerning the fate

320
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,531
of every single world
of our infinite multiverse.

321
00:22:03,564 --> 00:22:06,334
Where's the respect for elders?

322
00:22:08,302 --> 00:22:10,104
My dear Evelyn,

323
00:22:10,137 --> 00:22:11,506
I know you.

324
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,241
With every passing moment,

325
00:22:13,274 --> 00:22:15,076
you fear you might have
missed your chance

326
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:17,545
to make something of your life.

327
00:22:17,578 --> 00:22:19,313
I'm here to tell you

328
00:22:19,346 --> 00:22:20,948
every rejection,

329
00:22:20,981 --> 00:22:24,352
every disappointment
has led you here

330
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,221
to this moment.

331
00:22:26,987 --> 00:22:29,758
Don't let anything
distract you from it.

332
00:22:36,864 --> 00:22:38,867
Do you think this is funny?

333
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:44,072
So what will it be?

334
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:46,741
I'm thinking.

335
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:51,813
Our time here is up.

336
00:22:51,846 --> 00:22:53,514
- They're going to kill us.
- What?

337
00:22:53,547 --> 00:22:57,118
You think you can give us more
time so we can redo all this?

338
00:22:57,151 --> 00:22:59,120
Do not worry,
this is just a burner universe

339
00:22:59,153 --> 00:23:00,655
we are using for communication.

340
00:23:00,688 --> 00:23:02,190
Oh-oh-oh!

341
00:23:02,223 --> 00:23:03,991
You will know when
it is time to fight.

342
00:23:04,024 --> 00:23:06,727
You want to redo?
You're going to resubmit?

343
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,729
- I will be in contact soon.
- Shh, shh, shh.

344
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,032
I think my other husband
is messing up the audit.

345
00:23:11,065 --> 00:23:14,869
Maybe we can look at
all the receipts again and...

346
00:23:14,902 --> 00:23:18,239
Evelyn! Trust no-one. Oh!

347
00:23:30,017 --> 00:23:32,620
Oh, no, no. No, no, no. No...!

348
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,496
Oh, dear lord.

349
00:23:43,864 --> 00:23:46,400
OK. Everything OK.

350
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:49,470
I think I forget
something at home.

351
00:23:49,503 --> 00:23:51,806
Uh, sit down.

352
00:23:57,177 --> 00:23:59,781
I think I'm going
to regret this.

353
00:24:10,624 --> 00:24:12,160
You can go.

354
00:24:14,528 --> 00:24:16,264
What?

355
00:24:18,966 --> 00:24:21,769
You... you will have...

356
00:24:21,802 --> 00:24:24,805
You will have until
I leave the office tonight

357
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,442
to bring everything in,
6:00 P.M.

358
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:29,911
Last chance.

359
00:24:29,944 --> 00:24:32,380
- Oh, tomorrow is better...
- Thank you! Thank you!

360
00:24:32,413 --> 00:24:33,848
Thank you. 6:00 P.M.

361
00:24:33,881 --> 00:24:36,584
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you for the cookies.

362
00:24:36,617 --> 00:24:38,987
They look delicious.

363
00:24:42,723 --> 00:24:43,991
Last chance!

364
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,426
Have a nice day.

365
00:24:46,427 --> 00:24:47,962
Last chance.

366
00:25:02,843 --> 00:25:04,445
Oh, no.

367
00:25:05,479 --> 00:25:07,148
Evelyn! Evelyn!

368
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,060
So you know about this?

369
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:29,537
It was you. Like,
you who was in the elevator.

370
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,542
I was in the elevator.

371
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:35,977
Come back next week.

372
00:25:48,222 --> 00:25:49,924
I'm not ready to fight.

373
00:25:51,492 --> 00:25:53,527
I am not ready to fight.

374
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,862
Maybe we don't have a choice.

375
00:25:54,895 --> 00:25:56,097
What?

376
00:26:13,981 --> 00:26:16,150
Switch shoes to what?

377
00:26:16,183 --> 00:26:18,519
- Ow! Oh!
- Evelyn?!

378
00:26:18,552 --> 00:26:19,754
Someone call security!

379
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,355
What are you doing?

380
00:26:21,388 --> 00:26:22,623
You told me to do it!

381
00:26:22,656 --> 00:26:26,093
You said I would know
when it is the time to fight!

382
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,695
She was coming after us.

383
00:26:27,728 --> 00:26:30,031
Oh!

384
00:26:30,064 --> 00:26:33,601
Oh, you have no idea, lady. Oh!

385
00:26:33,634 --> 00:26:36,270
Assaulting an IRS agent?

386
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:39,507
You have no idea!

387
00:26:44,678 --> 00:26:47,415
"Dissolution of marriage"?

388
00:26:49,016 --> 00:26:50,751
Yes, I'm on the tenth floor.

389
00:26:50,784 --> 00:26:52,587
No...

390
00:27:04,198 --> 00:27:06,701
Your brother gets a divorce,

391
00:27:06,734 --> 00:27:09,503
now you think divorce is OK?

392
00:27:09,536 --> 00:27:11,372
I don't think it's OK!

393
00:27:13,574 --> 00:27:15,710
We made a sacred promise.

394
00:27:21,915 --> 00:27:24,252
I told you to stay low
and out of sight.

395
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:28,389
Oh, now you're here?

396
00:27:28,422 --> 00:27:31,292
Huh! Stop confusing me,
coming and going.

397
00:27:31,325 --> 00:27:32,469
- Stop it, stop it, stop...
- Relax.

398
00:27:32,493 --> 00:27:34,061
I'll get you out of this.

399
00:27:34,094 --> 00:27:35,396
Stop coming here.

400
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:38,599
OK, folks. Everyone remain calm.

401
00:27:38,632 --> 00:27:40,134
Oh, thank... thank God!

402
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:42,737
It's that one right there.
The Chinese lady!

403
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:43,971
No! It's all his fault!

404
00:27:44,004 --> 00:27:45,148
Right there, she assaulted me!

405
00:27:45,172 --> 00:27:47,074
OK, I need you two
to get on the ground

406
00:27:47,107 --> 00:27:48,542
with your hands
behind your heads.

407
00:27:48,575 --> 00:27:50,078
OK, OK, OK.

408
00:27:57,484 --> 00:27:58,953
Sir, please comply.

409
00:28:21,508 --> 00:28:24,345
OK, whatever you're thinking
about doing, don't do it.

410
00:28:36,723 --> 00:28:38,226
Sir?

411
00:28:58,545 --> 00:29:00,047
It's OK.

412
00:29:01,181 --> 00:29:03,584
OK, sir. That's enough.

413
00:29:16,396 --> 00:29:19,333
Oh!

414
00:29:42,422 --> 00:29:43,758
Holy shit.

415
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,233
Hyah!

416
00:30:00,807 --> 00:30:03,177
Oh!

417
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,272
Hey.

418
00:30:41,982 --> 00:30:43,885
Oh, no, Craig! Fuck.

419
00:30:52,793 --> 00:30:54,228
Arggh!

420
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,808
On your feet.

421
00:31:07,841 --> 00:31:10,711
Who... What is happening?

422
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:14,424
I'm not the Waymond
who wants to divorce you.

423
00:31:14,448 --> 00:31:16,083
I'm the Waymond
who is saving your life.

424
00:31:16,116 --> 00:31:17,393
Now, you can either come with me

425
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,086
and live up to
your ultimate potential

426
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:20,821
or lie here and live
with the consequences.

427
00:31:20,854 --> 00:31:22,390
I want to lie here.

428
00:31:23,156 --> 00:31:25,326
Hey, hey, hey.

429
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:27,027
No, no! Put me down! No, no!

430
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:46,080
Citizens of
the 4,655th Thetaverse,

431
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:48,682
you are about to be graced

432
00:31:48,715 --> 00:31:52,753
by the presence
of our sovereign leader,

433
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:54,355
Jobu Tupaki.

434
00:31:56,356 --> 00:31:59,159
Now let me assure you
of one thing.

435
00:31:59,192 --> 00:32:01,662
Just like the rest
of your miserable lives,

436
00:32:01,695 --> 00:32:03,364
this is nothing more

437
00:32:03,397 --> 00:32:06,600
than a statistical
inevitability.

438
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:11,105
Duck.

439
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:12,907
Duck.

440
00:32:14,508 --> 00:32:15,376
Duck...

441
00:32:15,409 --> 00:32:16,577
Jobu Tupaki

442
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:19,880
has seen all and knows all.

443
00:32:19,913 --> 00:32:22,216
She knows what makes you tick,

444
00:32:22,249 --> 00:32:27,455
on what fragile branches
your self-worth rests.

445
00:32:28,388 --> 00:32:31,158
This one.

446
00:32:42,636 --> 00:32:43,570
Hang on.

447
00:32:43,603 --> 00:32:46,440
Don't die yet, alright, buddy?

448
00:32:47,908 --> 00:32:50,011
Ugh.

449
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,390
It's not her.

450
00:33:03,423 --> 00:33:05,001
Police are
looking for all information.

451
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:06,293
This is a developing story.

452
00:33:06,326 --> 00:33:07,870
- What we do know...
- They might be close.

453
00:33:07,894 --> 00:33:10,197
We do have unconfirmed
photos of the suspects.

454
00:33:11,298 --> 00:33:12,433
An unidentified man

455
00:33:12,466 --> 00:33:13,901
went berserk
at the regional office

456
00:33:13,934 --> 00:33:16,537
for the Internal Revenue Service
in Simi Valley this morning.

457
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,014
Police aren't releasing
any information...

458
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:20,541
- Is that where your parents are?
- This is a developing story.

459
00:33:20,574 --> 00:33:22,409
- But we do have unconfirmed...
- Are you OK?

460
00:33:22,442 --> 00:33:23,544
Photos of the suspects.

461
00:33:23,577 --> 00:33:25,112
- If you recognise them...
- Hey!

462
00:33:25,145 --> 00:33:28,048
- Are you OK?
- ..help identify them.

463
00:33:28,081 --> 00:33:29,583
Joy?

464
00:33:31,952 --> 00:33:33,754
If you recognise these two,

465
00:33:33,787 --> 00:33:36,123
police are seeking help
identifying the assailants.

466
00:33:44,364 --> 00:33:46,433
My husband won't
even kill a spider.

467
00:33:46,466 --> 00:33:48,168
How can you be the same person?

468
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:49,970
You underestimate
how the smallest decisions

469
00:33:50,003 --> 00:33:53,006
can compound into significant
differences over a lifetime.

470
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,575
Every tiny decision creates

471
00:33:54,608 --> 00:33:56,743
another branching
universe, another...

472
00:33:56,776 --> 00:33:58,612
Were you not paying
attention before?

473
00:33:58,645 --> 00:34:00,948
Of course. You're just
very bad at explaining...

474
00:34:00,981 --> 00:34:02,383
Shh!

475
00:34:06,453 --> 00:34:08,122
Don't push me!

476
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:12,359
Oh, my God! We have to go back.

477
00:34:12,392 --> 00:34:13,560
We forgot my father!

478
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:16,230
Don't worry. We're
monitoring him. He's safe.

479
00:34:16,263 --> 00:34:17,663
- I don't know. Are you sure?
- Yes.

480
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,635
Hey, look, come on!

481
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:23,604
Look, this is your universe,

482
00:34:23,637 --> 00:34:26,874
one bubble floating in
the cosmic foam of existence.

483
00:34:26,907 --> 00:34:29,710
Every surrounding bubble
has slight variations.

484
00:34:29,743 --> 00:34:31,979
But the further away
you get from your universe,

485
00:34:32,012 --> 00:34:33,614
the bigger the differences.

486
00:34:33,647 --> 00:34:37,251
This is where I am from,
The Alphaverse.

487
00:34:38,018 --> 00:34:40,454
The first universe to make
contact with the others.

488
00:34:40,487 --> 00:34:42,623
You can call me Alpha Waymond.

489
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,528
In this world,

490
00:34:47,561 --> 00:34:50,397
you were a brilliant woman.

491
00:34:50,430 --> 00:34:51,965
In your search to prove

492
00:34:51,998 --> 00:34:53,600
the existence
of other universes,

493
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,836
you discovered a way
to temporarily link

494
00:34:55,869 --> 00:34:58,739
your consciousness to another
version of yourself,

495
00:34:58,772 --> 00:35:00,274
accessing all of their memories,

496
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:03,243
their skills,
even their emotions.

497
00:35:03,276 --> 00:35:06,713
Like you with the Fanny pack?

498
00:35:06,746 --> 00:35:09,850
Exactly.
It's called Verse Jumping.

499
00:35:09,883 --> 00:35:10,918
"Verse Jumping."

500
00:35:10,951 --> 00:35:13,287
I need you to learn
how to do it right now.

501
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,022
Right now?!

502
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,659
It may be our only chance
of getting out of here alive.

503
00:35:29,269 --> 00:35:30,804
Two guards coming this way.

504
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,973
On my signal, try to blend in.

505
00:35:34,774 --> 00:35:37,778
Why don't you get
your Evelyn to do this?

506
00:35:38,545 --> 00:35:40,380
My Evelyn is dead.

507
00:35:40,413 --> 00:35:42,082
Go! Oh, my God!

508
00:35:42,115 --> 00:35:43,383
Oh, my God, what is going on?

509
00:35:43,416 --> 00:35:45,152
Help us! Help us!

510
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,796
How did I die?

511
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:57,998
I've seen you die
a thousand ways,

512
00:35:58,031 --> 00:35:59,800
in a thousand worlds.

513
00:36:00,567 --> 00:36:03,470
In every single one,
you were murdered.

514
00:36:03,503 --> 00:36:05,639
What? Why would anybody
want to kill me?

515
00:36:05,672 --> 00:36:08,475
She's an omniversal being
with unimaginable power,

516
00:36:08,508 --> 00:36:10,177
an agent of pure chaos,

517
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,213
with no real motives or desires.

518
00:36:12,979 --> 00:36:15,582
- Jobu Tupaki.
- You're just making up sounds.

519
00:36:15,615 --> 00:36:17,651
Shh!

520
00:36:20,253 --> 00:36:21,922
We need another exit.

521
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,392
So let her destroy
the other bubbles.

522
00:36:25,425 --> 00:36:26,860
You said there are
so many of them.

523
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,129
Maybe it's OK if we lose some,

524
00:36:29,162 --> 00:36:31,232
but just leave me out of it.

525
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,936
It's not so simple.

526
00:36:38,605 --> 00:36:40,741
She's been building something.

527
00:36:41,508 --> 00:36:44,378
We thought it was
some sort of black hole.

528
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:45,579
But it appears to consume

529
00:36:45,612 --> 00:36:47,681
more than just light and matter.

530
00:36:47,714 --> 00:36:49,883
We don't know exactly
what it is.

531
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,185
We don't know what it's for.

532
00:36:52,218 --> 00:36:54,288
But we can all

533
00:36:54,321 --> 00:36:55,622
feel it.

534
00:36:55,655 --> 00:36:58,425
You've been feeling it too,
haven't you?

535
00:36:58,458 --> 00:37:00,027
Something is off.

536
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:03,063
Your clothes never wear
as well the next day.

537
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:06,066
Your hair never falls
in quite the same way.

538
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:08,269
Even your coffee tastes...

539
00:37:09,235 --> 00:37:10,871
wrong.

540
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:14,308
Our institutions are crumbling.

541
00:37:14,341 --> 00:37:17,110
Nobody trusts
their neighbour anymore.

542
00:37:17,143 --> 00:37:19,513
And you stay up at night
wondering to yourself...

543
00:37:19,546 --> 00:37:21,882
How can we get back?

544
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:27,054
This is
the Alphaverse's mission -

545
00:37:27,087 --> 00:37:29,956
to take us back
to how it's supposed to be.

546
00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:32,326
But that begins
with finding the one

547
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:36,130
who can stand up to Jobu's
perverse shroud of chaos.

548
00:37:37,163 --> 00:37:39,033
And you think it's me?

549
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,201
Why else would
we risk everything

550
00:37:41,234 --> 00:37:42,936
to get you out of here?

551
00:37:52,545 --> 00:37:55,482
Oh, there you are.

552
00:37:55,515 --> 00:37:57,818
Oh, Miss Deirdre!

553
00:37:57,851 --> 00:38:00,354
I'm sorry I punched you, but...

554
00:38:00,387 --> 00:38:01,922
Look.

555
00:38:01,955 --> 00:38:04,391
I think I finally
understand why...

556
00:38:07,227 --> 00:38:08,628
What is she doing?

557
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,464
Verse Jumping. Run!

558
00:38:19,706 --> 00:38:20,941
- Come on.
- Oh!

559
00:38:20,974 --> 00:38:23,310
Go! Go! Go!

560
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,150
She jumped somewhere.
Brute force.

561
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:31,318
The sumo wrestler?

562
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:32,652
- Body builder?
- Doesn't matter.

563
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,121
Counter with someone agile.

564
00:38:34,154 --> 00:38:36,857
On your perimeter, we've got
a break dancer, mime...

565
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:38,458
- A gymnast.
- Give me gymnast!

566
00:38:38,491 --> 00:38:39,726
- Go!
- Calculating route.

567
00:38:42,295 --> 00:38:44,264
OK,
some paper cuts, four of them.

568
00:38:44,297 --> 00:38:45,733
One between each finger.

569
00:38:49,102 --> 00:38:51,271
Paper cuts only happen
when you aren't trying.

570
00:38:51,304 --> 00:38:52,439
It's impossible.

571
00:38:52,472 --> 00:38:54,574
Probability - 1 in 8,000.

572
00:38:54,607 --> 00:38:57,277
It's the strongest
jumping pad we have.

573
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,248
- What are you doing?
- Come on, come on.

574
00:39:08,254 --> 00:39:10,023
There we go, one.

575
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:13,394
- There's two.
- Ooh.

576
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:16,897
- Ugh!
- Three.

577
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:19,666
Alright, come on, come on,
come on. Stick with me.

578
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,369
Come on.

579
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,411
- Four! There it is.

580
00:39:31,444 --> 00:39:33,413
OK, come on, jump!

581
00:39:41,488 --> 00:39:42,756
Huh!

582
00:39:42,789 --> 00:39:44,825
Is that pro wrestling?

583
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:46,792
She's going for a backbreaker!

584
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,492
- She's gotta run.
- No.

585
00:40:18,525 --> 00:40:20,627
She can jump,
somewhere she can fight.

586
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,895
She's not ready.

587
00:40:21,928 --> 00:40:24,164
A jump like that would fry
most people.

588
00:40:24,931 --> 00:40:26,900
She's not most people.

589
00:40:30,103 --> 00:40:33,273
Damn, what a weak body.

590
00:40:41,481 --> 00:40:43,416
- Hello?
- Evelyn!

591
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:44,851
Can you hear me?

592
00:40:44,884 --> 00:40:46,586
You're going to have
to Verse Jump.

593
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:48,222
Verse Jump?

594
00:40:59,032 --> 00:41:00,300
Hello?

595
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:01,535
Concentrate on a universe

596
00:41:01,568 --> 00:41:03,470
in which you studied
martial arts.

597
00:41:10,677 --> 00:41:13,046
OK, I'm locking in.

598
00:41:14,113 --> 00:41:15,849
Calculations complete.

599
00:41:15,882 --> 00:41:17,651
"Profess your love."

600
00:41:18,785 --> 00:41:21,321
You're gonna have
to profess your love to Deirdre.

601
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:24,090
- No way.
- It's your jumping pad.

602
00:41:24,123 --> 00:41:26,393
It's like eating the chapstick
or switching shoes.

603
00:41:26,426 --> 00:41:28,795
We developed an algorithm
that calculates

604
00:41:28,828 --> 00:41:30,172
which statistically
improbable action

605
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,932
will place you in a universe

606
00:41:31,965 --> 00:41:33,500
on the edge
of your local cluster,

607
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:36,269
which then sling shots you
to the desired universe.

608
00:41:37,904 --> 00:41:39,573
That doesn't make any sense!

609
00:41:39,606 --> 00:41:41,174
Exactly.

610
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,443
The less sense it makes,
the better.

611
00:41:43,476 --> 00:41:46,646
The Stochastic Path Algorithm
is fuelled by random actions.

612
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:48,982
Tell her you love her
and mean it.

613
00:41:49,015 --> 00:41:51,718
Are there any
other jumping pads?

614
00:41:52,585 --> 00:41:56,056
The next best paths are break
your own arm or take a nap.

615
00:41:56,089 --> 00:41:57,757
You're not sleepy, are you?

616
00:42:02,195 --> 00:42:03,163
I love you.

617
00:42:03,196 --> 00:42:04,965
Jumping pad failure.

618
00:42:04,998 --> 00:42:07,434
Evelyn, wait! No!

619
00:42:15,174 --> 00:42:16,576
No.

620
00:42:16,609 --> 00:42:18,445
She's in
a local divergent universe.

621
00:42:18,478 --> 00:42:20,013
No, no, no.

622
00:42:20,046 --> 00:42:21,949
She's gone home...

623
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,584
to finish the taxes.

624
00:42:28,054 --> 00:42:29,489
Ah!

625
00:42:46,673 --> 00:42:48,808
This doesn't make any sense.

626
00:42:48,841 --> 00:42:50,577
Think about it.

627
00:42:53,212 --> 00:42:55,482
You always get pulled away.

628
00:43:03,222 --> 00:43:04,624
Waymond!

629
00:43:04,657 --> 00:43:07,027
Waymond!

630
00:43:09,195 --> 00:43:10,964
I'm sorry, Evelyn.

631
00:43:10,997 --> 00:43:12,632
- Huh?
- I need to go.

632
00:43:12,665 --> 00:43:13,867
What?

633
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,802
I need to find the right Evelyn.

634
00:43:15,835 --> 00:43:17,904
And this one,

635
00:43:17,937 --> 00:43:19,739
it's not the one.

636
00:43:19,772 --> 00:43:22,275
No! No. Wait, let me try again!

637
00:43:24,377 --> 00:43:25,779
Alpha Waymond?

638
00:43:25,812 --> 00:43:27,914
Evelyn?!

639
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:31,751
- Oh.
- Huh?

640
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,622
Ah! What's happened to my hand?

641
00:43:41,027 --> 00:43:43,163
Go, go, go, go!

642
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:47,067
Evelyn, your face.

643
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,802
You just left me.

644
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:51,004
You just left me!

645
00:44:33,479 --> 00:44:34,479
Waymond...

646
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:38,451
Miss Deirdre?

647
00:44:38,484 --> 00:44:40,286
- I love you!
- What?

648
00:44:41,954 --> 00:44:43,189
I love you!

649
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,659
No, no!

650
00:44:48,594 --> 00:44:49,763
I love you!

651
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:08,648
I love you!

652
00:45:14,787 --> 00:45:16,790
I love...

653
00:45:37,743 --> 00:45:39,479
Evelyn!

654
00:46:04,237 --> 00:46:06,606
Cut, cut, cut, cut!

655
00:46:13,512 --> 00:46:16,049
Oh, I'm so
happy to be here today.

656
00:46:16,082 --> 00:46:18,518
- Evelyn!
- Evelyn!

657
00:46:18,551 --> 00:46:19,753
Evelyn!

658
00:47:00,493 --> 00:47:02,128
Oh!

659
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:18,545
Why did you... How?

660
00:47:30,656 --> 00:47:32,392
It was beautiful.

661
00:47:44,603 --> 00:47:45,939
Waymond.

662
00:47:47,006 --> 00:47:48,474
We better keep moving.

663
00:47:48,507 --> 00:47:51,912
Now you've definitely
got Jobu's attention. Come on.

664
00:48:03,189 --> 00:48:04,724
Stay calm.

665
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:07,727
Your brain is under
an incredible amount of stress.

666
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,430
No, let me finish
talking with my husband.

667
00:48:10,463 --> 00:48:13,199
He needs to know how good
my life could have been.

668
00:48:14,667 --> 00:48:17,003
- Evelyn! Evelyn!
- Evelyn!

669
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,476
- Ow!
- Are you with me?

670
00:48:24,243 --> 00:48:26,279
I thought I was disconnected.

671
00:48:26,312 --> 00:48:27,747
Why was I still there?

672
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:30,583
Your mind, it's like
a Clay pot holding water.

673
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,385
Every jump opens another crack,

674
00:48:32,418 --> 00:48:33,987
causing things to leak through.

675
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:36,690
With training, you will learn
to reseal these cracks.

676
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:40,694
Eat. You need energy.

677
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:44,631
Cream cheese.

678
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:47,767
Mmm!

679
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:51,204
In my universe,
the cattle were killed off.

680
00:48:51,237 --> 00:48:52,805
One of the many things
we've lost

681
00:48:52,838 --> 00:48:54,674
in our war against Jobu.

682
00:48:57,209 --> 00:48:58,945
Oh, my God.

683
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:00,480
What if...

684
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:03,116
what if I want to go back?

685
00:49:03,883 --> 00:49:06,586
What if I want to go back
to the other universe?

686
00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:09,188
Shut it down!
Shut it down, you hear me!

687
00:49:09,221 --> 00:49:11,124
- Come back!
- OK! OK! OK!

688
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:12,959
I... I'm back!

689
00:49:15,061 --> 00:49:16,763
Listen, you're only using

690
00:49:16,796 --> 00:49:18,798
the other worlds to acquire
special skills.

691
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:20,033
Do you understand?

692
00:49:20,066 --> 00:49:21,343
If you fall
for their temptations,

693
00:49:21,367 --> 00:49:23,636
you invite contradiction, chaos.

694
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:27,874
The Clay pot could shatter
and you could die, or far worse.

695
00:49:29,241 --> 00:49:31,411
What can be worse than death?

696
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:34,914
We should keep moving
until reinforcements come.

697
00:49:34,947 --> 00:49:36,349
No, no, no!

698
00:49:36,382 --> 00:49:40,820
Enough of your Clay pots,
cream cheese, no cows.

699
00:49:40,853 --> 00:49:43,690
Explain it all to me now.

700
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,863
You're right.

701
00:49:51,263 --> 00:49:52,765
In the Alphaverse,

702
00:49:52,798 --> 00:49:56,135
we began training many
young minds to Verse Jump.

703
00:49:56,168 --> 00:49:59,305
But there was one who was far
and above the most gifted.

704
00:49:59,338 --> 00:50:01,407
Our little explorer.

705
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,476
You saw her potential...

706
00:50:03,509 --> 00:50:05,745
so you pushed her

707
00:50:05,778 --> 00:50:07,480
beyond her limit.

708
00:50:07,513 --> 00:50:10,316
Warning. Unstable.

709
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:13,519
Though the
overloaded mind usually dies,

710
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:16,322
instead her mind was fractured.

711
00:50:17,256 --> 00:50:18,925
Warning. Unstable.

712
00:50:18,958 --> 00:50:21,027
- Mind fracturing.

713
00:50:24,029 --> 00:50:28,201
Now her mind
experiences every world,

714
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:29,569
every possibility,

715
00:50:29,602 --> 00:50:31,637
at the same exact time,

716
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:33,005
commanding
the infinite knowledge

717
00:50:33,038 --> 00:50:35,108
and power of the multiverse.

718
00:50:36,108 --> 00:50:37,443
Now she's seen too much,

719
00:50:37,476 --> 00:50:39,212
lost any sense of morality,

720
00:50:39,245 --> 00:50:41,314
any belief in objective truth.

721
00:50:41,347 --> 00:50:43,583
What does she want?

722
00:50:43,616 --> 00:50:45,918
No-one knows.

723
00:50:45,951 --> 00:50:47,320
All we know

724
00:50:47,353 --> 00:50:49,789
is she's looking for you.

725
00:50:53,859 --> 00:50:57,497
Hey, you said
I was the wrong one.

726
00:50:57,530 --> 00:51:00,967
What you did back there,
it changed my mind.

727
00:51:01,967 --> 00:51:04,504
You were incredible.

728
00:51:39,572 --> 00:51:41,174
Waymond.

729
00:52:05,598 --> 00:52:07,433
Of course.

730
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:27,286
Evelyn! Come back!

731
00:52:27,319 --> 00:52:28,730
Evelyn! Jump
to another combat universe!

732
00:52:28,754 --> 00:52:29,889
- Huh?
- Try peeing yourself!

733
00:52:29,922 --> 00:52:31,482
- Pee?
- It's always a good jumping pad!

734
00:52:35,227 --> 00:52:38,030
Come on, wake up! Wake up!

735
00:52:38,063 --> 00:52:39,298
What did you do to me?

736
00:52:39,331 --> 00:52:41,667
Did you staple something
to my forehead?

737
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,478
No! I didn't do anything.
You did it yourself!

738
00:52:43,502 --> 00:52:45,871
- Did we call for backup?
- I did not do it to myself!

739
00:52:45,904 --> 00:52:47,773
- Did you call?
- It has blood on it!

740
00:52:47,806 --> 00:52:51,444
We've detained the assailants.
No backup was requested.

741
00:52:51,477 --> 00:52:53,312
You guys are wasting
a trip up. Copy?

742
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:58,084
Oh, no! She found us.

743
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:00,519
I said, do you copy?

744
00:53:04,323 --> 00:53:05,925

You're going
to make me walk through you?

764
00:54:17,863 --> 00:54:20,800
Yeah, cute.
I can't let you do that either.

765
00:54:20,833 --> 00:54:23,703
Yeah, again with the 'can't'!

you understand

the meaning of that word.

768
00:54:39,818 --> 00:54:42,221
- See, I can walk through you.
- Officer down!

769
00:54:42,254 --> 00:54:44,390
- No, no! Don't shoot.
- Hands on your head.

00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,384
Oh, no!

773
00:55:16,321 --> 00:55:18,391
Oh, shit.

00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:23,229

- Oh!

775
00:55:23,262 --> 00:55:25,831
- No!
- Oh, no!

00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:28,701
Don't worry, Evelyn.

00:55:47,986 --> 00:55:50,222
Oh, my God.

781
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,260
You...

782
00:55:59,598 --> 00:56:03,002
You're Juju Toobootie.

783
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:09,008
The "Great Evil" Waymond
was talking about is...

784
00:56:09,041 --> 00:56:11,077
in my Joy?

785
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:16,348
Don't engage.

786
00:56:16,381 --> 00:56:17,917
She can't be reasoned with.

787
00:56:26,024 --> 00:56:27,360
Oh...

788
00:56:28,327 --> 00:56:29,562
It's you.

789
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:31,797
You're the reason my daughter

790
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:33,732
doesn't call anymore,

791
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:35,701
why she dropped out of college

792
00:56:35,734 --> 00:56:37,436
and gets tattoos.

793
00:56:37,469 --> 00:56:39,071
Aww!

794
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:41,474
You...

795
00:56:41,507 --> 00:56:44,343
are why she thinks she is gay.

796
00:56:44,376 --> 00:56:46,045
Ah!

797
00:56:46,078 --> 00:56:48,080
I'm so sorry.

798
00:56:49,214 --> 00:56:50,916
You're still hung up on the fact

799
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:53,119
that I like girls in this world?

800
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:57,289
The universe...

801
00:56:59,858 --> 00:57:02,561
is so much bigger
than you realise.

802
00:57:02,594 --> 00:57:05,397

803
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:07,099
OK!

804
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:10,102
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

805
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,135
Stop!

806
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,309
- Huh!
- Don't make me fight you.

807
00:57:17,342 --> 00:57:19,612
I am really good.

808
00:57:19,645 --> 00:57:21,113

00:57:37,763 --> 00:57:39,798

No, Evelyn,
you're not locked in!

00:57:47,239 --> 00:57:48,941

814
00:57:51,977 --> 00:57:53,212
Hmm.

00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,348
Where did she jump?

816
00:57:56,381 --> 00:57:58,484

00:58:38,023 --> 00:58:39,525

830
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,195
she's not most people.

831
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:45,497
Don't... Why are you
treating me like this?

832

00:58:47,032 --> 00:58:49,602
then one minute,
you're cold and awful.

00:58:52,504 --> 00:58:54,039
This is crazy!

835
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:56,108
You're starting to get it.

00:58:57,376 --> 00:58:59,111

841
00:59:24,503 --> 00:59:25,938
Here.

842
00:59:31,176 --> 00:59:34,113
Let me help you
open up your mind, huh?

843
00:59:35,247 --> 00:59:36,882
Hmm?

844
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:39,652
- Oh!

845
00:59:43,321 --> 00:59:45,891

00:59:47,426 --> 00:59:49,061

847
00:59:51,797 --> 00:59:53,566

What is that?

851
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:16,889
I got bored one day

852
01:00:16,922 --> 01:00:20,126
and I put everything on a bagel.

853
01:00:22,627 --> 01:00:24,496
Everything.

854
01:00:24,529 --> 01:00:28,801

Salt.

860
01:00:41,079 --> 01:00:43,348
And it collapsed in on itself.

01:01:02,667 --> 01:01:04,303
Nothing...

01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:07,373

872
01:01:19,117 --> 01:01:21,120
If nothing matters...

873
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,356
then all the pain

Again,
you deliberately disobey me

889
01:02:37,329 --> 01:02:41,033
and cause another mind
to be compromised.

890
01:02:44,169 --> 01:02:48,006
And now you know
what we must do.

891

No! Please.

892
01:02:50,408 --> 01:02:52,344

we've seen.

893
01:02:52,377 --> 01:02:55,113
She could finally stop
Jobu Tupaki.

01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:57,716
You mean the monster
that is inside my daughter?

895
01:02:57,749 --> 01:03:00,319
Well, why didn't you tell me
about it earlier?

896
01:03:00,352 --> 01:03:02,921
What else are you Alpha people
not telling me?

897
01:03:02,954 --> 01:03:05,224

901
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:18,303
I'm no good at anything.

902
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:19,538
Exactly.

01:03:19,571 --> 01:03:22,007

01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:24,409
but never an Evelyn like you.

905
01:03:24,442 --> 01:03:27,279
You have so many goals
you never finished,

906
01:03:27,312 --> 01:03:29,982
dreams you never followed.

907
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:32,685
You're living your worst you.

908
01:03:34,552 --> 01:03:37,923
I cannot be the worst.
What about that hot dog one?

909
01:03:37,956 --> 01:03:40,225
No. Can't you see?

910
01:03:40,258 --> 01:03:43,095
Every failure here
branched off into a success

911
01:03:43,128 --> 01:03:45,063
for another Evelyn
in another life.

912
01:03:45,096 --> 01:03:48,200
Most people only
have a few significant

913
01:03:48,233 --> 01:03:50,602
alternate life paths
so close to them.

914
01:03:50,635 --> 01:03:52,938
But you, here,

915
01:03:52,971 --> 01:03:55,908
you're capable of anything

916
01:03:55,941 --> 01:03:59,178
because you're so bad
at everything.

917
01:04:03,515 --> 01:04:05,417
What good is all that power
when her mind

918
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:09,187
is already succumbing
to that chaos, huh?

919
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,890
Hello?

920
01:04:11,923 --> 01:04:13,725
Hello? Mom, Dad?
What's going on?

921
01:04:13,758 --> 01:04:16,328
No. Do not answer her.

922
01:04:16,361 --> 01:04:18,664
It's one of her tricks.

923
01:04:18,697 --> 01:04:21,934
Sir, our readings indicate
it's not Jobu Tupaki.

924
01:04:22,934 --> 01:04:24,303
But if she's not here...

925
01:04:27,906 --> 01:04:29,074
Oh, shit!

926
01:04:32,344 --> 01:04:35,647
Do not engage! Run! Run!

927
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,450
Watch these two here
while I deal with Jobu.

928
01:04:38,483 --> 01:04:42,587
I'm not risking the safety
of the Alphaverse for this.

929
01:04:46,291 --> 01:04:48,427
Get us as far away
from Joy as you can.

930
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:49,995
- Why?
- I'll be back. I promise.

931
01:04:50,028 --> 01:04:52,164
No, no, no, wait.
Why don't you...

932
01:04:52,197 --> 01:04:53,265
Huh?

933
01:04:53,298 --> 01:04:54,933
- Hello?
- Joy?

934
01:04:54,966 --> 01:04:56,210
- No, no... That's not...
- Joy's here!

935
01:04:56,234 --> 01:04:57,645
- No, no, no, that's not Joy.
- Hello?

936
01:04:57,669 --> 01:05:01,273
- Joy? Joy, I'm coming.
- Let me in.

937
01:05:01,306 --> 01:05:04,510
OK, be patient! This is heavy.

938
01:05:05,543 --> 01:05:08,213
- Joy, why are you here?
- I have no fucking clue!

939
01:05:08,246 --> 01:05:10,349
- Hey, gentle language!
- Just what is going on?

940
01:05:10,382 --> 01:05:12,918
I'm sure there's a very good
explanation for all of this...

941
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:16,822
What the fuck, Mom?!

942
01:05:17,956 --> 01:05:19,925
What the fuck are you doing?

943
01:05:27,766 --> 01:05:30,436
But... she's too powerful.

944
01:05:31,736 --> 01:05:34,306
Are we all having a stroke?

945
01:05:43,681 --> 01:05:46,385
You are like puppets.
You know? Puppets?

946
01:05:46,418 --> 01:05:49,121
You can do things
you normally cannot do.

947
01:05:49,154 --> 01:05:51,223
It's like that movie.

948
01:05:51,256 --> 01:05:53,525
Um, you... you... That movie...

949
01:05:53,558 --> 01:05:55,027
OK, what are you talking about?

950
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:56,728
- A movie?
- 'Raccaccoonie'!

951
01:05:56,761 --> 01:05:57,896
- What?
- Huh?

952
01:05:57,929 --> 01:05:58,864
'Raccaccoonie', you know?

953
01:05:58,897 --> 01:06:00,932
The one with the chef...

954
01:06:00,965 --> 01:06:02,601
And he makes bad food. Phooey.

955
01:06:02,634 --> 01:06:04,703
And then this raccoon
sit on his head,

956
01:06:04,736 --> 01:06:08,840
ooh, control him,
and then he cooks good food.

957
01:06:08,873 --> 01:06:11,043
Do you mean 'Ratatouille'?

958
01:06:11,076 --> 01:06:12,611
'Ratatouille'?
I like that movie.

959
01:06:12,644 --> 01:06:15,013
No. No, no, no, no, no.
'Raccaccoonie'!

960
01:06:15,046 --> 01:06:16,181
With the raccoon.

961
01:06:16,214 --> 01:06:17,749
- OK...
- Raccoon?

962
01:06:17,782 --> 01:06:19,518
Everybody,
stop making up sounds!

963
01:06:19,551 --> 01:06:22,687
So there's a raccoon Joy,
and there's a raccoon me?

964
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,423
And they are controlling us?

965
01:06:24,456 --> 01:06:26,291
Yeah, from the other universes.

966
01:06:28,226 --> 01:06:30,095
- Oh. OK.
- That's very funny, Evelyn.

967
01:06:30,128 --> 01:06:33,832
OK, it sounds a little bit
ridiculous, but it's true.

968
01:06:33,865 --> 01:06:35,367
I swear to God, you...

969
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:36,768
You are macho man.

970
01:06:36,801 --> 01:06:38,537
- I like that!
- Oh, yeah.

971
01:06:41,072 --> 01:06:42,340
Hey, honey, don't worry.

972
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:44,142
- Daddy will get you out of this.
- Ah Ba?

973
01:06:44,175 --> 01:06:47,479
Quickly,
while she is distracted.

974
01:06:48,279 --> 01:06:50,382
- No.
- It's only protocol.

975
01:06:50,415 --> 01:06:53,318
It gives her one
less universe to access.

976
01:06:53,351 --> 01:06:54,619
God...

977
01:06:54,652 --> 01:06:56,455
- Can you...
- Oh, it's Becky.

978
01:06:56,488 --> 01:06:57,956
Hi, Becky. Hold on.

979
01:06:57,989 --> 01:07:00,192
How do you expect to defeat
her in every universe

980
01:07:00,225 --> 01:07:01,927
if you can't even
kill her in one?

981
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,328
Hey, babe.

982
01:07:03,361 --> 01:07:05,330
She's your granddaughter.

983
01:07:06,097 --> 01:07:09,267
How do you think I feel?

984
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:11,236
But this is a sacrifice

985
01:07:11,269 --> 01:07:13,872
that is necessary
to win the war.

986
01:07:13,905 --> 01:07:16,508
OK, there we go.

987
01:07:20,812 --> 01:07:22,548
You must do it.

988
01:07:23,781 --> 01:07:25,417
Go.

989
01:07:28,219 --> 01:07:29,521
Go.

990
01:07:29,554 --> 01:07:31,656
Yeah, my mom
taped me to a chair.

991
01:07:31,689 --> 01:07:33,825
Uh, because of raccoons.

992
01:07:33,858 --> 01:07:35,927
- OK, be patient.
- Yeah, it's a long story.

993
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:37,996
- Daddy's trying to...
- It's been a day.

994
01:07:45,637 --> 01:07:46,705
Mom?

995
01:07:46,738 --> 01:07:48,373
I don't like this at all.

996
01:07:57,916 --> 01:07:59,618
What are you...

997
01:08:02,020 --> 01:08:03,789
what are you doing?

998
01:08:07,292 --> 01:08:09,194
Hey! I almost had it.

999
01:08:09,227 --> 01:08:10,695
Oh, come on!

1000
01:08:10,728 --> 01:08:12,130
You are already under her spell.

1001
01:08:12,163 --> 01:08:14,332
Holy shit!
Holy shit, he has a gun!

1002
01:08:14,365 --> 01:08:15,600
Everyone, stay calm!

1003
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:17,244
I think it's time
for a family discussion!

1004
01:08:17,268 --> 01:08:19,337
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK.

1005
01:08:22,674 --> 01:08:25,043
I won't let you kill her.

1006
01:08:25,076 --> 01:08:28,780
Don't you see what
is happening to your mind?

1007
01:08:30,014 --> 01:08:31,750
In my universe,

1008
01:08:31,783 --> 01:08:36,054
you pushed your own daughter
too hard until you broke her.

1009
01:08:36,087 --> 01:08:38,957
You...

1010
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:41,860
you created Jobu Tupaki.

1011
01:08:41,893 --> 01:08:43,962
When did he get
so good at English?

1012
01:08:45,096 --> 01:08:47,165
Now I must stop you.

1013
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:49,301
Otherwise, it's only
a matter of time

1014
01:08:49,334 --> 01:08:53,739
before you become just like her.

1015
01:08:55,273 --> 01:08:59,544
Just like her?

1016
01:09:05,650 --> 01:09:08,720
- Huh?
- What the fuck are you doing?

1017
01:09:08,753 --> 01:09:11,590
Evelyn, I don't think now
is a good time to dance!

1018
01:09:15,226 --> 01:09:16,561
Baba,

1019
01:09:16,594 --> 01:09:18,296
I know you don't agree with me,

1020
01:09:18,329 --> 01:09:19,864
but this is something
I have to do.

1021
01:09:19,897 --> 01:09:21,566
- What the...
- That sounds weird.

1022
01:09:21,599 --> 01:09:23,368
No, no, no...

1023
01:09:23,401 --> 01:09:25,303
- OK.
- Wait!

1024
01:09:25,336 --> 01:09:26,616
You don't know
where you'll jump.

1025
01:09:29,274 --> 01:09:31,210
Enough!

1026
01:09:32,243 --> 01:09:34,012
Warning. Unstable.

1027
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:47,559
Please.

1028
01:09:47,592 --> 01:09:50,595
I cannot lose another
loved one to the darkness.

1029
01:09:50,628 --> 01:09:54,766
- Warning. Unstable.
- Don't worry. You won't.

1030
01:10:07,045 --> 01:10:10,282
Hey, uh, clean up
in there, alright?

1031
01:10:10,315 --> 01:10:12,017
Here. Oh!

1032
01:10:14,619 --> 01:10:16,054
Where did she jump?!

1033
01:10:16,087 --> 01:10:17,756
Sorry, Ah Ba.

1034
01:10:20,291 --> 01:10:22,060
- Whoa!
- OK!

1035
01:10:22,093 --> 01:10:23,671
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Jesus, Mom!

1036
01:10:23,695 --> 01:10:24,929
- That way!
- Oh, no!

1037
01:10:24,962 --> 01:10:26,731
- Oh, my God!
- Come on, come on!

1038
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:28,133
- Oh!
- No!

1039
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:30,802
Warning, mind fracturing.

1040
01:10:30,835 --> 01:10:34,439
Send every Jumper with
a counterpart in the area.

1041
01:10:34,472 --> 01:10:36,675
Now!

1042
01:10:37,442 --> 01:10:40,278
Once again,
the Alphaverse finds itself

1043
01:10:40,311 --> 01:10:44,783
as the last line of defence
against total chaos.

1044
01:10:44,816 --> 01:10:48,920
Be brave. This Evelyn
is as stubborn as the others.

1045
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:51,122
She has given us no choice.

1046
01:10:51,155 --> 01:10:55,694
We must kill her before she
becomes another Jobu Tupaki.

1047
01:10:57,528 --> 01:10:59,931
- Joy.
- Oh, what?

1048
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:01,800
Joy... Joy...

1049
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:06,871
I know you have these feelings,

1050
01:11:06,904 --> 01:11:10,742
feelings that make you so sad.

1051
01:11:11,542 --> 01:11:15,914
That makes you just...
just want to give up.

1052
01:11:17,281 --> 01:11:19,117
It's not your fault.

1053
01:11:20,084 --> 01:11:21,620
Not your fault.

1054
01:11:22,387 --> 01:11:24,289
I know.

1055
01:11:25,356 --> 01:11:27,492
It's... it's her.

1056
01:11:27,525 --> 01:11:30,328
Juju Chewbacca.

1057
01:11:32,430 --> 01:11:35,800
She has your soul...

1058
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:37,602
in the palm of her hand.

1059
01:11:37,635 --> 01:11:38,937
What are you talking about?

1060
01:11:38,970 --> 01:11:43,108
The only way I can
defeat her to save you...

1061
01:11:44,175 --> 01:11:46,678
is to become like her.

1062
01:11:50,748 --> 01:11:52,050
Evelyn!

1063
01:11:52,083 --> 01:11:54,452
Your daughter is beyond saving.

1064
01:11:54,485 --> 01:11:56,621
And soon you will be too.

1065
01:12:00,725 --> 01:12:02,460
Your time is up.

1066
01:12:02,493 --> 01:12:04,863
Find your jumping pads.

1067
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:10,969
♪ Ave Maria... ♪

1068
01:12:14,205 --> 01:12:16,875
♪ Ave Maria... ♪

1069
01:12:24,515 --> 01:12:26,785
Mom? Mom?

1070
01:12:26,818 --> 01:12:29,388
I think
you're pushing things too far.

1071
01:12:31,489 --> 01:12:32,957
Or not far enough.

1072
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:36,895
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1073
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:41,166
Evelyn?

1074
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:42,867
- Ugh!
- Oh, my God.

1075
01:12:45,636 --> 01:12:46,905
Oh!

1076
01:12:46,938 --> 01:12:48,673
What are you doing?!

1077
01:13:50,701 --> 01:13:52,470
Mom!

1078
01:14:48,259 --> 01:14:49,327
Arggh!

1079
01:14:54,398 --> 01:14:55,834
Ohh!

1080
01:15:10,748 --> 01:15:13,585
Holy... shit.

1081
01:15:13,618 --> 01:15:15,186
Is he dead?

1082
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:19,991
See, not dead. Go!

1083
01:15:20,024 --> 01:15:22,224
- That's definitely not...
- Hurry up, please. Go quick!

1084
01:15:22,793 --> 01:15:24,796
OK, come on, guys.

1085
01:15:27,131 --> 01:15:28,566
Dad, go!

1086
01:15:35,606 --> 01:15:37,075
Oh, my God.

1087
01:15:39,844 --> 01:15:43,248
Does my baby
want to go for a walk?

1088
01:15:51,989 --> 01:15:53,691
Yow!

1089
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:57,996
No!

1090
01:15:58,029 --> 01:16:00,498
Oh, Johnny! Oh!

1091
01:16:03,034 --> 01:16:04,168
Orange soda?

1092
01:16:04,201 --> 01:16:06,004
- Huh?
- What is she doing?

1093
01:16:06,037 --> 01:16:07,805
I think when
she does something weird

1094
01:16:07,838 --> 01:16:09,607
it helps her fight,
it gives her power.

1095
01:16:12,677 --> 01:16:14,012
Sorry, baby.

1096
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:23,521
Ask her for another one.

1097
01:16:31,162 --> 01:16:32,930
No! Johnny!

1098
01:16:37,902 --> 01:16:39,371
Fried egg?

1099
01:16:40,504 --> 01:16:43,675
You... bitch.

1100
01:16:46,877 --> 01:16:48,446
Go!

1101
01:16:49,847 --> 01:16:52,183
Huh?

1102
01:16:52,216 --> 01:16:53,952
Oh...

1103
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:56,087
Evelyn, if you don't step up,

1104
01:16:56,120 --> 01:16:57,989
I'm giving some
of your shifts to Chad.

1105
01:17:00,491 --> 01:17:02,760
Yeah!

1106
01:17:02,793 --> 01:17:04,562
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, good one!

1107
01:17:04,595 --> 01:17:05,863
I got a picture!

1108
01:17:18,676 --> 01:17:20,445
Go.

1109
01:18:03,854 --> 01:18:05,323
Stop...

1110
01:18:05,356 --> 01:18:07,024
- Huh? What happened?
- You stop!

1111
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:08,192
I think they lost their...

1112
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:09,994
- Stop it!
- ..powers?

1113
01:18:10,961 --> 01:18:12,396
Sir?

1114
01:18:12,429 --> 01:18:14,499
I am gonna need
another jumping pad.

1115
01:18:14,532 --> 01:18:16,701
Received information. Over.

1116
01:18:23,307 --> 01:18:25,085
I think she needs to do
something weird again.

1117
01:18:25,109 --> 01:18:26,644
What's he doing?

1118
01:18:37,454 --> 01:18:39,924
Oh, my God. He's trying
to stick it in his butt.

1119
01:18:39,957 --> 01:18:41,726
No!

1120
01:18:42,827 --> 01:18:44,262
- No, no, no!
- Ah... No!

1121
01:18:46,197 --> 01:18:48,099
Ah, Evelyn, do jumping Jacks!

1122
01:18:48,132 --> 01:18:49,500
That's not weird at all.

1123
01:18:49,533 --> 01:18:50,935
Um... Slap him!

1124
01:18:50,968 --> 01:18:52,637
No, no, no, no!

1125
01:18:52,670 --> 01:18:54,739
Mom, just blow on his nose!

1126
01:18:54,772 --> 01:18:56,040
What?

1127
01:18:56,073 --> 01:18:57,642
It'll make him involuntarily

1128
01:18:57,675 --> 01:18:59,310
scream and do weird noises.

1129
01:18:59,343 --> 01:19:01,779
Trust her, Evelyn!
It's really weird.

1130
01:19:54,431 --> 01:19:56,200
Wow, Mom is really good.

1131
01:19:56,233 --> 01:19:58,403
Huh!

1132
01:19:59,904 --> 01:20:01,439
Sorry.

1133
01:20:21,058 --> 01:20:22,460
Oh!

1134
01:20:24,595 --> 01:20:26,197
Arggh!

1135
01:20:34,104 --> 01:20:35,773
Ahh!

1136
01:20:56,427 --> 01:20:58,229
Reaching mental capacity.

1137
01:21:00,097 --> 01:21:01,732
Reaching mental capacity.

1138
01:21:03,968 --> 01:21:04,968
Holy shit!

1139
01:21:06,236 --> 01:21:09,240
- Ow!
- I'm sorry, Evelyn.

1140
01:21:09,273 --> 01:21:11,409
- Mind fracturing.
- We'll die together.

1141
01:21:31,095 --> 01:21:33,197
Pinky... Arggh!

1142
01:21:35,599 --> 01:21:37,602
- Get her. I see her.
- Let's go!

1143
01:22:13,003 --> 01:22:14,271
Evelyn!

1144
01:22:14,304 --> 01:22:16,207
Evelyn. Evelyn!

1145
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:17,375
Whoa, whoa!

1146
01:22:22,012 --> 01:22:24,248
No need to explain.

1147
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:28,019
I have been watching you.

1148
01:22:28,052 --> 01:22:30,688
You're back!

1149
01:22:31,588 --> 01:22:33,591
Did you see how good I am?

1150
01:22:34,691 --> 01:22:36,193
I'm gonna do it.

1151
01:22:36,226 --> 01:22:39,930
I am going to defeat
that Jobu Tupaki.

1152
01:22:39,963 --> 01:22:42,700
Hey. You got her name right.

1153
01:22:44,268 --> 01:22:48,873
Evelyn, what you're doing
is crazy, reckless.

1154
01:22:48,906 --> 01:22:52,376
Your stupid plan to somehow
save your daughter

1155
01:22:52,409 --> 01:22:56,314
has managed to piss off
everyone in the multiverse.

1156
01:22:57,514 --> 01:22:59,550
But it just might work.

1157
01:23:03,187 --> 01:23:04,488
What? What?

1158
01:23:17,668 --> 01:23:19,904
I only wish I could be there

1159
01:23:19,937 --> 01:23:21,138
to see you finish this.

1160
01:23:21,171 --> 01:23:23,107
What do you mean,
you don't see me finish?

1161
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:25,209
I'm grateful

1162
01:23:25,242 --> 01:23:26,877
that chance was kind enough

1163
01:23:26,910 --> 01:23:29,814
to let us have these
last few moments together.

1164
01:23:45,829 --> 01:23:47,365
Alpha Waymond?

1165
01:23:48,132 --> 01:23:49,967
Alpha Waymond?

1166
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,169
What happened?

1167
01:23:52,202 --> 01:23:54,539
Was I Raccoon Waymond again?

1168
01:23:57,608 --> 01:23:59,443
Raccoon Waymond is dead.

1169
01:24:03,113 --> 01:24:04,916
Is that Raccoon Joy?

1170
01:24:05,916 --> 01:24:07,385
Am I getting it?

1171
01:24:09,553 --> 01:24:11,489
I can to stop you, Jobu...

1172
01:24:11,522 --> 01:24:14,792
now that I am reaching
my full potential.

1173
01:24:14,825 --> 01:24:17,328
Oh, you still can't see
what's happening.

1174
01:24:17,361 --> 01:24:19,430
No, I see clearly.

1175
01:24:19,463 --> 01:24:22,967
More clearly than ever before.

1176
01:24:38,148 --> 01:24:40,451
Oh, my God! Evelyn.

1177
01:24:41,752 --> 01:24:43,020
Oh, my God!

Hi, Mrs Wang.

1221
01:28:39,423 --> 01:28:41,024
Hey, Mom.
So, about this morning...

1222
01:28:41,057 --> 01:28:42,793
- Enough with your tricks.
- What?

1223
01:28:42,826 --> 01:28:44,103
- I know you're in there.
- Whoa.

1224
01:28:44,127 --> 01:28:45,629
- Get out of my daughter.
- OK!

1225
01:28:45,662 --> 01:28:47,264
Mom, are you already drunk?

1226
01:28:51,401 --> 01:28:53,404
- Hey, Becky.
- Mmm-hmm?

1227
01:28:54,571 --> 01:28:57,308
Can you go help my dad
with the party?

1228
01:28:59,176 --> 01:29:00,677
Now?

1229
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:02,780
- Yeah.
- Go, Becky.

1230
01:29:02,813 --> 01:29:04,581
Go. Go.

1231
01:29:07,150 --> 01:29:08,819
Thanks, babe.

1232
01:29:12,789 --> 01:29:14,925
You see it all, don't you?

1233
01:29:19,596 --> 01:29:22,566
You can see

1234
01:29:22,599 --> 01:29:24,435
how everything...

1235
01:29:25,569 --> 01:29:27,805
is just a random rearrangement

1236
01:29:27,838 --> 01:29:32,209

what you are talking about.

But I can do this.

01:29:43,753 --> 01:29:45,222
Huh?

1240
01:29:45,255 --> 01:29:47,624
But you see...

1241
01:29:47,657 --> 01:29:49,827
how everything we do...

1242
01:29:49,860 --> 01:29:51,662
Huh?

You're like me.

1247
01:30:08,612 --> 01:30:09,947
That's right.

1248
01:30:09,980 --> 01:30:12,616
I'm the one you're looking for.

1250
01:30:15,185 --> 01:30:17,054
OK.

1251
01:30:19,055 --> 01:30:20,791
Hit me.

1252
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:24,195
Punch my face.

1253
01:30:32,836 --> 01:30:34,404

I will take care of it!

1260
01:30:54,090 --> 01:30:56,159
- She'll take care of it, Dad.
- Go.

1261
01:30:56,192 --> 01:30:57,394
- Honey, you OK?
- It's OK.

1262
01:30:57,427 --> 01:30:59,696
- Go!
- Yeah, I just fell on the couch.

1263
01:30:59,729 --> 01:31:01,198
Go!

1264
01:31:01,231 --> 01:31:02,800
OK.

1265
01:31:04,301 --> 01:31:05,869
Oh.

1266
01:31:05,902 --> 01:31:07,505
- Ow...
- He's so sweet.

1267
01:31:09,306 --> 01:31:11,308
OK.

1268
01:31:11,341 --> 01:31:13,010
Hey, hey, buddy!

1269
01:31:13,043 --> 01:31:17,314
If you don't want
to fight me, then...

1270
01:31:17,347 --> 01:31:19,016
- Why?
- Why what?

1271
01:31:19,049 --> 01:31:20,884
What... what's all this for?

1272
01:31:22,886 --> 01:31:25,422
Why was I looking for you?

1273
01:31:25,455 --> 01:31:27,024
Yeah.

1274
01:31:30,527 --> 01:31:32,229
Sit down.

1275
01:31:32,996 --> 01:31:34,765
Sit down, grab a snack,

1276
01:31:34,798 --> 01:31:36,633
make yourself comfortable, huh?

1277
01:31:36,666 --> 01:31:39,136
- Oh, hey, you OK?
- OK.

1278
01:31:40,570 --> 01:31:43,574
Mmm. We can speed this up.

1279
01:31:43,607 --> 01:31:46,910
Sit on the crack.

1280
01:31:46,943 --> 01:31:49,212
Sit on the crack
of the couch, OK?

1281
01:31:49,245 --> 01:31:50,447
Get comfortable.

1282
01:32:01,725 --> 01:32:03,393
Bagel.

1283
01:32:06,730 --> 01:32:09,166
Please, I don't care
about the bagel.

1284
01:32:09,199 --> 01:32:11,068
I don't care
about the Alphaverse.

1285
01:32:11,101 --> 01:32:12,903
I only care about my Joy.

1286
01:32:12,936 --> 01:32:14,171
Give me back my daughter

1287
01:32:14,204 --> 01:32:15,839
and I'll leave you
alone forever.

1288
01:32:15,872 --> 01:32:18,342
Sorry! No can do.

1289
01:32:18,375 --> 01:32:19,476
Why not?

1290
01:32:19,509 --> 01:32:22,179
I am your daughter.
Your daughter is me.

1291
01:32:22,212 --> 01:32:26,950
Every version of Joy
is Jobu Tupaki.

1292
01:32:26,983 --> 01:32:29,553
- You can't separate us.
- No.

1293
01:32:29,586 --> 01:32:34,224
I have felt everything
your daughter has felt.

1294
01:32:37,961 --> 01:32:41,565
And I know the joy...

1295
01:32:42,966 --> 01:32:45,970
and the pain of having you
as my mother.

1296
01:32:47,737 --> 01:32:50,273
Then you know I would do...

1297
01:32:50,306 --> 01:32:54,445
Only do the right thing
for her, for you.

1298
01:32:55,445 --> 01:32:59,483
'Right' is a tiny box invented
by people who are afraid

1299
01:32:59,516 --> 01:33:03,487
and I know what it feels like
to be trapped inside that box.

1300
01:33:06,456 --> 01:33:08,025
Mom...

1301
01:33:08,058 --> 01:33:09,960
No, it's not like that.

1302
01:33:09,993 --> 01:33:11,595
It's Gong Gong.

1303
01:33:11,628 --> 01:33:12,929
He's a different generation.

1304
01:33:12,962 --> 01:33:15,399
You don't have to hide
behind him anymore.

1305
01:33:15,432 --> 01:33:17,134
You should feel relieved.

1306
01:33:17,167 --> 01:33:20,537
The bagel will show you
the true nature of things.

1307
01:33:20,570 --> 01:33:23,874
You'll be free from that box,
just like me.

1308
01:33:23,907 --> 01:33:26,209
No, no, I'm not like you.

1309
01:33:26,242 --> 01:33:29,579
You're young and your mind
is always changing.

1310
01:33:29,612 --> 01:33:31,782
I still know who I am.

1311
01:33:31,815 --> 01:33:34,017
You have no idea
what you've done.

1312
01:33:34,050 --> 01:33:36,654
You're stuck like this forever.

1313
01:33:38,221 --> 01:33:41,058
No, I'm going back with my Joy,

1314
01:33:41,091 --> 01:33:44,361
to my family, to live my life.

1315
01:33:44,394 --> 01:33:45,796
A happy life.

1316
01:33:45,829 --> 01:33:47,798
OK.

1317
01:33:49,833 --> 01:33:52,002
Good luck with that.

1318
01:34:04,981 --> 01:34:06,349
Thank you so much for coming.

1319
01:34:11,354 --> 01:34:13,590
Thank you. Thank your father.

1320
01:34:27,036 --> 01:34:29,139
All this time...

1321
01:34:30,607 --> 01:34:34,111
I wasn't looking for you
so I could kill you.

1322
01:34:36,546 --> 01:34:40,984
I was just looking for someone
who could see what I see.

1323
01:34:43,019 --> 01:34:46,457
Feel what I feel.

1324
01:35:08,611 --> 01:35:10,814
And that someone...

1325
01:35:15,051 --> 01:35:16,787
is you.

1326
01:35:18,588 --> 01:35:20,457
Evelyn!

1327
01:35:20,490 --> 01:35:23,327
- You're alive!
- Impossible.

1328
01:35:27,397 --> 01:35:29,132
- Hello?
- Mrs Wang?

1329
01:35:29,165 --> 01:35:30,567
Where... where are you?

1330
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:34,404
I mean, to not even show up
for your appointment?!

1331
01:35:34,437 --> 01:35:35,672
Shut up.

1332
01:35:35,705 --> 01:35:36,907
What did you just say?

1333
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:38,809
I said shut up.

1334
01:35:38,842 --> 01:35:40,310
You don't matter.

1335
01:35:40,343 --> 01:35:42,379
Whatever I did, I'm sorry.

1336
01:35:42,412 --> 01:35:43,680
Nothing matters.

1337
01:35:43,713 --> 01:35:45,549
Mrs Wang!

1338
01:35:45,582 --> 01:35:48,685
You are gonna
be in serious trouble!

1339
01:35:48,718 --> 01:35:50,587
Do you understand?

1340
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:53,023
For you to disrespect...

1341
01:36:19,048 --> 01:36:22,552
Happy New Year!

1342
01:36:22,585 --> 01:36:24,387
Another year, hmm?

1343
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:26,323
Pretending we know
what we're doing,

1344
01:36:26,356 --> 01:36:30,561
but, really, we're just going
around in circles.

1345
01:36:31,828 --> 01:36:34,231
Doing laundry and taxes,

1346
01:36:34,264 --> 01:36:36,300
and laundry and taxes.

1347
01:36:44,274 --> 01:36:45,809
- No more running.
- Excuse me.

1348
01:36:45,842 --> 01:36:48,178
Where are the owners? Oh.

1349
01:36:48,945 --> 01:36:51,048
There you are. Mr and Mrs Wang.

1350
01:36:51,814 --> 01:36:56,453
You have left me no option
but to authorise the seizure

1351
01:36:56,486 --> 01:36:59,022
of your personal
and your business assets.

1352
01:36:59,055 --> 01:37:00,824
- You have to vacate...
- Wait, Evelyn!

1353
01:37:07,630 --> 01:37:09,799
It's just so good, you know?

1354
01:37:09,832 --> 01:37:11,668
What are you doing? No! No!

1355
01:37:11,701 --> 01:37:14,337
My God, Chad, I told
you she couldn't be trusted!

1356
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:16,440
Evelyn, please! Calm down.

1357
01:37:17,307 --> 01:37:19,609
Within 48 hours or...

1358
01:37:27,850 --> 01:37:29,519
Everything...

1359
01:37:32,789 --> 01:37:34,057
Ugh!

1360
01:37:39,896 --> 01:37:41,665
What are you doing?

1361
01:37:47,670 --> 01:37:50,140
Not a single moment will go by

1362
01:37:50,173 --> 01:37:52,008
without every other universe

1363
01:37:52,041 --> 01:37:54,378
screaming for your attention.

1364
01:37:56,779 --> 01:37:58,915
Never fully there.

1365
01:37:58,948 --> 01:38:01,518
Just a lifetime of...

1366
01:38:01,551 --> 01:38:02,953
No, no!

1367
01:38:02,986 --> 01:38:04,154
Fractured moments.

1368
01:38:04,187 --> 01:38:06,056
Raccaccoonie!

1369
01:38:06,089 --> 01:38:08,758
Contradictions and confusion...

1370
01:38:08,791 --> 01:38:10,894
- Get off me!
- Chad, don't forget about me.

1371
01:38:10,927 --> 01:38:12,362
Here are the papers.

1372
01:38:12,395 --> 01:38:16,600
- Oh! Oh, officer?
- OK, OK.

1373
01:38:23,873 --> 01:38:25,709
With only a few specks of time

1374
01:38:25,742 --> 01:38:28,979
where anything
actually makes any sense.

1375
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:34,551
I've always hated this place.

1376
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:42,559
Raccaccoonie!

1377
01:38:42,592 --> 01:38:44,127
Chad!

1378
01:38:46,863 --> 01:38:49,733
Get off me! Get off!

1379
01:39:01,344 --> 01:39:03,780
Evelyn, why?!

1380
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:14,437
Do you know why
I actually built the bagel?

1381
01:42:15,471 --> 01:42:18,708
It wasn't to destroy everything.

1382
01:42:19,609 --> 01:42:22,078
It was to destroy myself.

1383
01:42:23,079 --> 01:42:27,150
I wanted to see if I went in,
could I finally escape?

1384
01:42:29,318 --> 01:42:31,688
Like, actually die.

1385
01:42:34,156 --> 01:42:36,193
At least this way...

1386
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:39,196
I don't have to do it alone.

1387
01:42:45,534 --> 01:42:47,203
You're not listening.

1388
01:42:47,236 --> 01:42:49,105
This is out of my league...

1389
01:42:49,138 --> 01:42:51,374
Judge Brenner signed...

1390
01:42:54,677 --> 01:42:58,081
Well, excuse me!
Excuse me, Mr Wang.

1391
01:42:58,114 --> 01:43:00,025
Every person I know
is going through a hard time.

1392
01:43:00,049 --> 01:43:02,953
- It's a hard time...
- Evelyn!

1393
01:43:06,155 --> 01:43:07,958
Come back.

1394
01:43:12,595 --> 01:43:15,131
My silly husband.

1395
01:43:15,164 --> 01:43:18,268
Probably making things worse.

1396
01:43:18,301 --> 01:43:20,070
Ignore it.

1397
01:43:25,341 --> 01:43:27,577
OK, you can let her go.

1398
01:43:28,844 --> 01:43:33,650
You, let her go. It's OK. Yes!

1399
01:43:35,418 --> 01:43:37,053
Thank you.

1400
01:43:52,401 --> 01:43:55,138
How? That's impossible.

1401
01:43:55,171 --> 01:43:57,674
It's just
a statistical inevitability.

1402
01:43:57,707 --> 01:43:59,776
It's nothing special.

1403
01:44:08,384 --> 01:44:10,053
I don't know.

1404
01:44:10,086 --> 01:44:12,122
I just talked to her.

1405
01:44:52,995 --> 01:44:54,264
Please!

1406
01:44:58,501 --> 01:44:59,736
Please!

1407
01:44:59,769 --> 01:45:02,705
Can we...
can we just stop fighting?

1408
01:45:17,453 --> 01:45:18,788
I know you are all fighting

1409
01:45:18,821 --> 01:45:22,158
because you're scared
and confused.

1410
01:45:24,093 --> 01:45:26,096
I'm confused too.

1411
01:45:29,532 --> 01:45:31,101
All day...

1412
01:45:32,635 --> 01:45:35,205
I don't know
what the heck is going on.

1413
01:45:36,272 --> 01:45:38,808
But somehow...

1414
01:45:39,742 --> 01:45:42,145
this feels like
it's all my fault.

1415
01:45:57,893 --> 01:46:00,430
I don't know.

1416
01:46:02,465 --> 01:46:04,367
The only thing I do know...

1417
01:46:05,334 --> 01:46:07,437
is that we have to be kind.

1418
01:46:13,042 --> 01:46:14,644
Please.

1419
01:46:14,677 --> 01:46:16,312
Be kind...

1420
01:46:17,079 --> 01:46:20,116
especially when
we don't know what's going on.

1421
01:46:39,368 --> 01:46:40,937
Hey, Evelyn!

1422
01:46:42,438 --> 01:46:44,073
Bagel.

1423
01:46:46,575 --> 01:46:49,345
Evelyn...

1424
01:46:50,946 --> 01:46:54,217
You can still turn around
and avoid all this.

1425
01:46:54,250 --> 01:46:55,785
Please...

1426
01:46:56,552 --> 01:46:58,087
be kind.

1427
01:47:00,856 --> 01:47:03,659
It's too late, Waymond.

1428
01:47:06,262 --> 01:47:08,131
Don't say that.

1429
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:29,952
Did you see that?

1430
01:47:32,187 --> 01:47:33,689
Ooh! Ooh-ooh! Ooh!

1431
01:47:33,722 --> 01:47:35,324
- Huh! Found it!
- Check this!

1432
01:47:35,357 --> 01:47:37,860
What song is this?

1433
01:47:40,930 --> 01:47:43,232
Thanks. Thank you for coming.

1434
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:46,135
That's very funny.

1435
01:47:46,969 --> 01:47:48,771
- Yeah, that's it?
- Yeah!

1436
01:48:48,130 --> 01:48:49,699
I'm sorry too.

1437
01:49:21,330 --> 01:49:23,232
Oh!

1438
01:49:24,633 --> 01:49:27,470
So cute!

1439
01:49:27,503 --> 01:49:29,572
Come on, Evelyn.

1440
01:49:30,539 --> 01:49:32,075
Come on.

1441
01:49:35,811 --> 01:49:37,346
Oh.

1442
01:49:37,379 --> 01:49:39,315
I get it.

1443
01:49:42,484 --> 01:49:44,454
Feeling a good thing.

1444
01:49:45,688 --> 01:49:47,457
You got your hopes up.

1445
01:49:48,357 --> 01:49:50,893
So I'm here
to save you some time.

1446
01:49:53,696 --> 01:49:55,365
Eventually...

1447
01:49:58,567 --> 01:50:00,136
that all just goes away.

1448
01:50:00,169 --> 01:50:02,304
Just goes away.

1449
01:50:02,337 --> 01:50:03,539
Come on.

1450
01:50:34,870 --> 01:50:37,773
I don't care
if you come with me.

1451
01:50:37,806 --> 01:50:39,575
Enjoy your life.

1452
01:50:56,959 --> 01:50:59,095
Ugh!

1453
01:50:59,128 --> 01:51:01,464
Evelyn! Evelyn, please!

1454
01:51:01,497 --> 01:51:03,232
No more!

1455
01:51:05,267 --> 01:51:07,236
I don't want to hurt you.

1456
01:51:13,976 --> 01:51:15,778
Joy, come back with me.

1457
01:51:15,811 --> 01:51:18,347
Joy! Joy!

1458
01:51:28,257 --> 01:51:32,061
What did my silly husband
say to you?

1459
01:51:33,462 --> 01:51:36,065
He told me about your situation.

1460
01:51:37,533 --> 01:51:40,836
I remembered when my husband
served me papers.

1461
01:51:40,869 --> 01:51:44,707
I drove his Kia Forte
through my neighbour's kitchen.

1462
01:51:44,740 --> 01:51:46,475
Huh!

1463
01:51:46,508 --> 01:51:48,310
But you know what I say?

1464
01:51:48,343 --> 01:51:52,782
It's called,
"Unlovable bitches like us..."

1465
01:51:53,849 --> 01:51:56,352
"Make the world go 'round."

1466
01:52:04,126 --> 01:52:06,095
Don't stop playing.

1467
01:52:06,128 --> 01:52:08,431
Play something for me.

1468
01:52:23,512 --> 01:52:25,414
That's not true.

1469
01:52:28,617 --> 01:52:31,720
- You're not unlovable.
- You're not unlovable!

1470
01:52:31,753 --> 01:52:33,823
What are you talking about?

1471
01:52:33,856 --> 01:52:36,259
There is always
something to love.

1472
01:52:37,326 --> 01:52:40,129
Even in a stupid,
stupid universe

1473
01:52:40,162 --> 01:52:43,365
where we have
hot dogs for fingers,

1474
01:52:43,398 --> 01:52:45,734
we'd get very good
with our feet.

1475
01:53:03,619 --> 01:53:05,154
Oh!

1476
01:53:08,757 --> 01:53:10,960
- See?
- OK.

1477
01:53:10,993 --> 01:53:13,729
I feel nothing.

1478
01:53:13,762 --> 01:53:17,166
I... I feel...

1479
01:53:17,199 --> 01:53:19,068
I feel...

1480
01:53:31,013 --> 01:53:33,515
Don't let her stop Jobu!

1481
01:53:33,548 --> 01:53:34,917
Open fire!

1482
01:54:29,838 --> 01:54:30,940
So stupid!

1483
01:54:47,956 --> 01:54:49,325
Evelyn?

1484
01:54:50,926 --> 01:54:52,294
What are you doing?

1485
01:54:52,327 --> 01:54:56,599
I'm learning to fight like you.

1486
01:55:38,140 --> 01:55:39,975
You know, Evelyn, my wife

1487
01:55:40,008 --> 01:55:41,877
used to wear
that exact same perfume,

1488
01:55:41,910 --> 01:55:43,512
God rest her soul.

1489
01:55:48,683 --> 01:55:50,486
These are direct indications

1490
01:55:50,519 --> 01:55:52,921
that there's some impingement
of the nervous system.

1491
01:55:54,222 --> 01:55:55,491
With a little bit of help,

1492
01:55:55,524 --> 01:55:58,093
we could be seeing things
nice and straight.

1493
01:56:01,696 --> 01:56:03,332
You might feel a little sore,

1494
01:56:03,365 --> 01:56:05,300
but everything
is looking pretty good.

1495
01:56:05,333 --> 01:56:07,570
Thank you.

1496
01:56:11,940 --> 01:56:13,709
Clean up in there, alright?

1497
01:56:23,085 --> 01:56:24,420
Hah!

1498
01:57:25,780 --> 01:57:28,117
You took everything
away from me.

1499
01:57:28,150 --> 01:57:29,819
I'm sorry.

1500
01:57:30,585 --> 01:57:33,422
Raccaccoonie taught me so much!

1501
01:57:33,455 --> 01:57:35,824
I... I didn't even know

1502
01:57:35,857 --> 01:57:37,359
how to boil an egg

1503
01:57:37,392 --> 01:57:41,964
and he taught me
how to spin it on a spatula.

1504
01:57:43,532 --> 01:57:45,767
I'm useless alone.

1505
01:57:47,102 --> 01:57:49,538
We're all useless alone.

1506
01:57:49,571 --> 01:57:51,974
It's a good thing
you're not alone.

1507
01:57:52,941 --> 01:57:54,009
Oh!

1508
01:57:55,544 --> 01:57:57,880
Let's go rescue
your silly raccoon.

1509
01:57:59,581 --> 01:58:02,151
Oh, we're gonna do it!

1510
01:58:26,308 --> 01:58:29,311
Arggh!

1511
01:58:34,115 --> 01:58:36,351
Oh-ho-ho!

1512
01:58:51,866 --> 01:58:54,002
Get out of the way!

1513
01:59:09,718 --> 01:59:11,654
Waymond!

1514
01:59:22,897 --> 01:59:24,299
See?

1515
01:59:24,332 --> 01:59:25,901
It's only a matter of time

1516
01:59:25,934 --> 01:59:27,669
before everything
balances itself out.

1517
01:59:27,702 --> 01:59:29,571
- Come on, come on, come on!
- I can't.

1518
01:59:29,604 --> 01:59:32,374
I'm sorry, Raccaccoonie!
I'm sorry!

1519
01:59:36,444 --> 01:59:39,181
Evelyn, let her go.

1520
02:00:21,556 --> 02:00:24,192
But she turned out
to be stubborn,

1521
02:00:24,225 --> 02:00:27,696
aimless, a mess.

1522
02:00:27,729 --> 02:00:29,632
Just like her mother.

1523
02:00:30,565 --> 02:00:32,534
But now I see.

1524
02:00:32,567 --> 02:00:35,137
It's OK that she's a mess.

1525
02:00:36,771 --> 02:00:39,441
Because just like me...

1526
02:00:39,474 --> 02:00:41,210
Huh.

1527
02:02:28,116 --> 02:02:30,318
Well, maybe you win
in this universe,

1528
02:02:30,351 --> 02:02:32,754
but in another time...

1529
02:02:36,724 --> 02:02:39,027
I beat you!

1530
02:02:40,228 --> 02:02:41,396
Ohh!

1531
02:02:41,429 --> 02:02:43,231
Or we tie!

1532
02:02:47,902 --> 02:02:50,238
Or we just...

1533
02:02:50,271 --> 02:02:51,807
hang around.

1534
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:53,775
OK, Joy, listen.

1535
02:02:55,577 --> 02:02:56,945
Because it's all
just a pointless

1536
02:02:56,978 --> 02:02:58,547
swirling bucket of bullshit.

1537
02:02:58,580 --> 02:03:00,215
Huh!

1538
02:03:01,850 --> 02:03:05,821
That bagel is where
we finally find peace, Evelyn.

1539
02:03:08,957 --> 02:03:12,694
Stop calling me Evelyn!

1540
02:03:24,172 --> 02:03:25,407
I

1541
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:27,976
Am.

1542
02:03:28,009 --> 02:03:30,045
Your

1543
02:03:30,078 --> 02:03:31,814
mother!

1544
02:03:41,756 --> 02:03:43,192
Ah Ba?

1545
02:03:49,631 --> 02:03:51,366
Seriously?

1546
02:03:51,399 --> 02:03:53,635
Can you please just...

1547
02:03:53,668 --> 02:03:56,271
stop?!

1548
02:03:58,673 --> 02:04:00,509
Mom.

1549
02:04:00,542 --> 02:04:02,978
Just... just stop.

1550
02:04:03,778 --> 02:04:06,415
Good for you.
You're figuring your shit out.

1551
02:04:07,849 --> 02:04:12,154
And that's great. I'm really,
really happy for you.

1552
02:04:13,454 --> 02:04:15,324
But I'm...

1553
02:04:16,591 --> 02:04:18,494
I'm tired.

1554
02:04:20,662 --> 02:04:22,163
I don't want to hurt anymore.

1555
02:04:22,196 --> 02:04:24,933
And for some reason
when I'm with you, it just...

1556
02:04:26,968 --> 02:04:29,304
it just hurts the both of us.

1557
02:04:32,907 --> 02:04:36,211
So let's just go
our separate ways, OK?

1558
02:04:37,779 --> 02:04:40,282
Just let me go.

1559
02:04:52,594 --> 02:04:54,229
OK.

1560
02:05:29,631 --> 02:05:31,300
Wait.

1561
02:05:38,339 --> 02:05:39,741
You are getting fat.

1562
02:05:39,774 --> 02:05:41,142
And you never call me

1563
02:05:41,175 --> 02:05:42,611
even though we have
a family plan.

1564
02:05:42,644 --> 02:05:44,245
- What?
- And it's free.

1565
02:05:44,278 --> 02:05:46,781
You only visit
when you need something.

1566
02:05:46,814 --> 02:05:48,984
And you got a tattoo
and I don't care

1567
02:05:49,017 --> 02:05:51,419
if it's supposed
to represent our family.

1568
02:05:51,452 --> 02:05:53,021
You know I hate tattoos.

1569
02:05:53,054 --> 02:05:55,790
And of all the places
I could be,

1570
02:05:55,823 --> 02:05:58,259
why would I want
to be here with you?

1571
02:05:58,292 --> 02:06:00,495
Yes, you're right.

1572
02:06:00,528 --> 02:06:02,430
It doesn't make sense.

1573
02:06:02,463 --> 02:06:03,599
Evelyn!

1574
02:06:04,732 --> 02:06:06,435
Let her finish.

1575
02:06:08,870 --> 02:06:10,606
Maybe it's like you said.

1576
02:06:11,673 --> 02:06:14,309
Maybe there is
something out there,

1577
02:06:14,342 --> 02:06:16,044
some new discovery

1578
02:06:16,077 --> 02:06:17,646
that will make us feel

1579
02:06:17,679 --> 02:06:20,549
like even smaller
pieces of shit.

1580
02:06:21,683 --> 02:06:23,852
Something that explains why

1581
02:06:23,885 --> 02:06:26,855
you still went looking for me

1582
02:06:26,888 --> 02:06:29,358
through all of this noise.

1583
02:06:31,592 --> 02:06:33,261
And why,

1584
02:06:33,294 --> 02:06:35,296
no matter what,

1585
02:06:35,329 --> 02:06:38,000
I still want
to be here with you.

1586
02:06:39,734 --> 02:06:42,104
I will always...

1587
02:06:43,404 --> 02:06:45,007
always...

1588
02:06:45,773 --> 02:06:48,510
want to be here with you.

1589
02:06:50,912 --> 02:06:53,048
So what? You...

1590
02:06:55,983 --> 02:06:59,021
You're just gonna
ignore everything else?

1591
02:06:59,987 --> 02:07:03,158
You could be anything, anywhere.

1592
02:07:06,961 --> 02:07:10,065
Why not go somewhere
where your...

1593
02:07:12,900 --> 02:07:15,404
where your daughter
is more than just...

1594
02:07:17,071 --> 02:07:18,974
this?

1595
02:07:20,541 --> 02:07:22,844
Here, all we get

1596
02:07:22,877 --> 02:07:26,147
are a few specks of time

1597
02:07:26,180 --> 02:07:29,718
where any of this
actually makes any sense.

1598
02:07:35,490 --> 02:07:37,292
Then I will Cherish

1599
02:07:37,325 --> 02:07:40,562
these few specks of time.

1600
02:07:48,169 --> 02:07:50,438
You push the button.

1601
02:07:50,471 --> 02:07:52,674
Yeah, there you go.

1602
02:07:52,707 --> 02:07:54,442
I feel like I'm 14.

1603
02:07:54,475 --> 02:07:56,644
Yeah.

1604
02:07:56,677 --> 02:07:59,948
You're a crazy woman!

1605
02:07:59,981 --> 02:08:01,716
Takes one to know one.

1606
02:08:01,749 --> 02:08:05,253
I'm sorry, Raccaccoonie!
I'm sorry!

1607
02:08:05,286 --> 02:08:07,656
- What are you doing?
- Grab my hair.

1608
02:08:21,702 --> 02:08:24,106
What did he say?

1609
02:08:51,399 --> 02:08:54,669
♪ We're a family... ♪

1610
02:08:59,607 --> 02:09:04,479
♪ Family... ♪

1611
02:09:36,711 --> 02:09:38,814
This is so awkward.

1612
02:09:40,915 --> 02:09:42,851
This is awkward, right?

1613
02:09:47,121 --> 02:09:49,624
Do you still want
to do your party?

1614
02:09:50,825 --> 02:09:53,528
We can do whatever we want.

1615
02:09:57,665 --> 02:09:59,167
Nothing matters.

1616
02:10:12,747 --> 02:10:15,717
OK, we're definitely
late now, guys.

1617
02:10:17,885 --> 02:10:19,587
Do you have to bring all these?

1618
02:10:19,620 --> 02:10:20,889
Mmm-hmm.

1619
02:10:20,922 --> 02:10:22,857
That needs to go in the bag too.

1620
02:10:22,890 --> 02:10:25,827
Taxes suck.

1621
02:10:34,936 --> 02:10:36,872
Thank you for the ride, Becky!

1622
02:10:37,872 --> 02:10:39,807
Hey, it's good.

1623
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:41,242
Mmm-hmm. You got this, OK?

1624
02:10:41,275 --> 02:10:42,710
- Becky?
- I'll call you after.

1625
02:10:42,743 --> 02:10:44,579
You need to grow your hair.

1626
02:10:48,249 --> 02:10:49,884
Wow.

1627
02:10:53,020 --> 02:10:54,989
I'll call you later!

1628
02:10:55,022 --> 02:10:56,691
Hurry, hurry!

1629
02:11:01,228 --> 02:11:02,931
I gotta pee. Hold on.

1630
02:11:02,964 --> 02:11:04,699
OK. Hurry.

1631
02:11:40,801 --> 02:11:43,237
OK. Yes.

1632
02:11:43,270 --> 02:11:46,674
I am happy to say I do think

1633
02:11:46,707 --> 02:11:48,009
things are better.

1634
02:11:48,042 --> 02:11:50,278
This is... this is
an improvement.

1635
02:11:50,311 --> 02:11:52,347
And I'm glad that you listened.

1636
02:11:52,380 --> 02:11:54,182
But we have a problem

1637
02:11:54,215 --> 02:11:56,484
because you listened,
but you didn't listen

1638
02:11:56,517 --> 02:11:58,353
and that has to do
with the Schedule C.

1639
02:11:58,386 --> 02:12:01,422
You see, you did...

1640
02:12:11,632 --> 02:12:14,002
Evelyn! Did you hear me?

1641
02:12:14,035 --> 02:12:17,472
