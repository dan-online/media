[energy cannons firing]

176
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,387
[speaking native language]

177
00:09:29,095 --> 00:09:31,220
Why do we always get the fun missions?

178
00:09:31,303 --> 00:09:32,887
Oh, this isn't the fun part.

179
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,679
Getting back to the Square
is the fun part.

180
00:09:34,762 --> 00:09:36,387
[metal screeching]

181
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:40,845
Waxer, Boil, am I glad to see you.

182
00:09:41,387 --> 00:09:43,637
Trapper and I
are the only ones still alive.

183
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,720
Good to see you, sir.

184
00:09:44,804 --> 00:09:47,720
Commander Cody's established
the square just beyond this position.

185
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:50,637
The bugs are on the move and trying
to surround us as we speak, sir.

186
00:09:53,804 --> 00:09:54,929
They've got the general.

187
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:59,220
AT-TE 636,
lay down cover fire at 0.35.

188
00:10:09,261 --> 00:10:10,762
Take it down! Take it down!

189
00:10:17,845 --> 00:10:18,887
Are you injured, General?

190
00:10:19,637 --> 00:10:21,220
[Kenobi] No, nothing too serious.

191
00:10:21,303 --> 00:10:22,720
What's the situation here?

192
00:10:22,804 --> 00:10:25,178
Ah. We've got no air cover,

193
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:27,345
two generals on the ground
beyond our position,

194
00:10:27,428 --> 00:10:29,178
and a mess of bugs surrounding us.

195
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:31,720
The enemy was more than prepared
for our attack, sir.

196
00:10:31,804 --> 00:10:33,595
They knew our every move.

197
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:36,095
Well, I'm sure General Skywalker
and General Mundi

198
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:37,637
will make it to our position.

199
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,845
We just have to make sure
we're still here when they arrive.

200
00:10:41,845 --> 00:10:43,845
[metal screeching]

201
00:11:03,303 --> 00:11:04,428
Negative, Captain.

202
00:11:04,512 --> 00:11:06,929
We will be unable to provide
any air support at this time.

203
00:11:07,011 --> 00:11:08,595
I understand that, sir.

204
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,261
But we have three attack forces
on the ground

205
00:11:10,345 --> 00:11:12,095
and only one at the landing zone.

206
00:11:12,178 --> 00:11:14,929
This is a planetary wide
invasion, Captain.

207
00:11:15,011 --> 00:11:16,929
If I devote resources to your position,

208
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:19,929
it will mean sacrificing
other areas of the campaign.

209
00:11:20,011 --> 00:11:23,261
<i>All we can do at this time</i>
<i>is help you find General Skywalker.</i>

210
00:11:23,345 --> 00:11:25,303
All right, sir.
I'll report to the General.

211
00:11:25,387 --> 00:11:26,428
Commander Jet out.

212
00:11:26,512 --> 00:11:28,553
Give me every fighter you can scrape up.

213
00:11:30,053 --> 00:11:32,345
Have you located
General Skywalker's position?

214
00:11:32,428 --> 00:11:35,261
We think he's somewhere
along the eastern barrier.

215
00:11:35,345 --> 00:11:38,220
That's not a barrier. It's a fortress.

216
00:11:44,512 --> 00:11:45,845
[blasters firing]

217
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:47,637
-Gentlemen, careful.
-[screaming]

218
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,053
Well, this is another
fine mess you've gotten us into.

219
00:11:53,136 --> 00:11:55,553
What? Hey, it's not my fault.

220
00:11:55,637 --> 00:11:57,679
You were supposed to study the holomaps.

221
00:11:57,762 --> 00:11:59,178
I did!

222
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:02,845
Remember, when I reminded you
about the giant wall,

223
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:04,887
and you said, "Don't worry, Snips.

224
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:07,345
We won't be anywhere near that."

225
00:12:07,428 --> 00:12:08,929
Just get ready to climb.

226
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,428
General, I left a squad
to protect the tanks.

227
00:12:13,512 --> 00:12:16,136
Are you sure this is the shortest way
to the landing zone?

228
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,220
No, I'm not sure, Commander.

229
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,428
All I can do is trust my instincts.

230
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,804
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I have a wing vibration up ahead.

231
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:46,679
[shrieking]

232
00:12:46,762 --> 00:12:48,762
[screaming]

233
00:12:52,053 --> 00:12:52,887
[blaster firing]

234
00:12:57,929 --> 00:13:00,136
Don't stop. We must push on.

235
00:13:00,804 --> 00:13:01,720
Forward!

236
00:13:03,053 --> 00:13:04,303
So what's the plan, General?

237
00:13:04,387 --> 00:13:05,804
Just keep us covered, Rex.

238
00:13:05,887 --> 00:13:08,303
There's too much laser fire
for all of us to make the climb.

239
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:09,804
Ahsoka and I will handle this.

240
00:13:09,887 --> 00:13:11,762
Just be ready when that wall comes down.

241
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,679
[explosions]

242
00:13:54,553 --> 00:13:56,553
[screams]

243
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:58,637
[blasters firing]

244
00:13:59,637 --> 00:14:01,845
How many droids have you shot down so far?

245
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:03,261
Twenty-five.

246
00:14:03,345 --> 00:14:05,887
Ah, you're falling behind. Let's go.

247
00:14:15,762 --> 00:14:16,845
[explosion]

248
00:14:23,178 --> 00:14:25,095
Focus on the droids
on the top of the wall.

249
00:14:31,261 --> 00:14:32,470
[screams]

250
00:14:32,553 --> 00:14:33,387
Man down!

251
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,595
Hang on. There they are!

252
00:14:36,804 --> 00:14:38,804
[energy cannons firing]

253
00:14:44,387 --> 00:14:45,220
Ah!

254
00:14:46,053 --> 00:14:47,136
[shrieks]

255
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,011
[explosions]

256
00:15:01,553 --> 00:15:02,804
Look for a hatch.

257
00:15:02,887 --> 00:15:05,387
We need to put the explosives
inside the wall.

258
00:15:06,261 --> 00:15:07,470
Found one.

259
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,095
[blasters firing]

260
00:15:31,845 --> 00:15:34,261
Hey, did you get them?

261
00:15:34,345 --> 00:15:35,845
-[Anakin] Catch.
-Huh? Wha...

262
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,845
No!

263
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:40,303
-Come on, Rex.
-Up and away.

264
00:15:41,011 --> 00:15:41,845
Whoa!

265
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,887
Help!

266
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:48,970
[massive explosion]

267
00:15:49,887 --> 00:15:53,136
[screaming]

268
00:16:09,053 --> 00:16:11,595
Next time, just tell me to jump.

269
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,637
Now where's the fun in that?

270
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,929
Come on, we can't keep Obi-Wan waiting.

271
00:16:16,011 --> 00:16:17,679
You heard him, lads. Let's go!

272
00:16:27,804 --> 00:16:29,136
We're almost through.

273
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,595
Bring in the flamethrowers!

274
00:16:38,387 --> 00:16:40,387
[Geonosians shrieking]

275
00:16:41,178 --> 00:16:42,553
Look, what's that?

276
00:16:47,428 --> 00:16:49,428
[all shrieking]

277
00:16:51,553 --> 00:16:53,470
[Anakin] <i>Master Mundi, do you read me?</i>

278
00:16:53,553 --> 00:16:55,178
We are here, Skywalker.

279
00:16:55,261 --> 00:16:58,470
We took a slight detour that put us
out of communications for a bit.

280
00:16:58,553 --> 00:17:00,929
[Anakin] <i>This has been a day</i>
<i>for detours, Master.</i>

281
00:17:01,011 --> 00:17:02,887
Indeed. But now the road is clear.

282
00:17:03,428 --> 00:17:04,887
I can see the landing zone.

283
00:17:05,553 --> 00:17:06,762
It does not look good.

284
00:17:07,804 --> 00:17:09,220
Can you get me Admiral Yularen?

285
00:17:13,303 --> 00:17:15,303
Admiral, we're at the breaking point.

286
00:17:15,387 --> 00:17:16,887
You've got to get some fighters down here.

287
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,845
You are in luck, General Skywalker.

288
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:20,470
I have one squadron available.

289
00:17:27,387 --> 00:17:28,512
[screams]

290
00:17:29,595 --> 00:17:31,845
Retreat! Go, go, go, go!

291
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:35,845
[explosion]

292
00:17:36,804 --> 00:17:38,804
[blasters firing]

293
00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:43,011
Make every shot count!
Give it all you got!

294
00:17:45,428 --> 00:17:48,595
Reinforcements!
The reinforcements have arrived!

295
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:50,679
[engines whooshing]

296
00:17:50,762 --> 00:17:51,595
[explosion]

297
00:17:54,136 --> 00:17:56,929
[all cheering]

298
00:17:57,512 --> 00:17:59,470
Go, go, go, go!

299
00:17:59,553 --> 00:18:00,720
Move it! Move it!

300
00:18:00,804 --> 00:18:01,845
You heard him, lads, let's go!

301
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:03,178
Up to the front!

302
00:18:04,345 --> 00:18:06,053
Come on! Hurry, hurry!

303
00:18:06,762 --> 00:18:08,762
There they are. Move it, move it!

304
00:18:10,804 --> 00:18:11,887
Master Kenobi.

305
00:18:13,512 --> 00:18:15,011
Well, what happened to you?

306
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:18,011
I might ask you the same question.

307
00:18:18,095 --> 00:18:21,553
Our combined forces should be enough
to destroy the shield generator.

308
00:18:21,637 --> 00:18:24,970
Anakin, you'll need to take
a small squad through the shield,

309
00:18:25,053 --> 00:18:27,637
as close as you can get
to their gun emplacements.

310
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,220
From there, you'll be able to temporarily
jam their scanners

311
00:18:31,303 --> 00:18:34,095
so they are unable to target
the incoming tanks.

312
00:18:34,178 --> 00:18:36,303
Once the tanks knock out the shield,

313
00:18:36,387 --> 00:18:39,553
Master Mundi can bring the rest of
the troops in with the gunships.

314
00:18:40,512 --> 00:18:41,929
Consider it done, Master.

315
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:50,804
All units are in position, sir.

316
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,679
Tell Skywalker to start the attack.

317
00:18:54,762 --> 00:18:55,845
Begin the attack.

318
00:19:03,804 --> 00:19:05,804
[blasters firing]

319
00:19:35,553 --> 00:19:37,303
Let's jam their scanners.

320
00:19:37,387 --> 00:19:38,512
Droid poppers ready.

321
00:19:41,595 --> 00:19:43,220
[energy warbling]

322
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:47,387
Looks like it's working.

323
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,804
It won't last long.

324
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:49,887
Bring up the tanks.

325
00:19:56,053 --> 00:19:58,470
[energy cannons firing]

326
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:06,095
[massive explosion]

327
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,845
[speaking native language]

328
00:20:32,303 --> 00:20:34,387
So, Master, what was your total?

329
00:20:35,595 --> 00:20:36,970
Not now, Ahsoka.

330
00:20:37,053 --> 00:20:38,261
Come on.

331
00:20:38,345 --> 00:20:40,345
Are you afraid you lost this time?

332
00:20:40,428 --> 00:20:42,804
Fine. 55, that's my count.

333
00:20:42,887 --> 00:20:43,887
And you?

334
00:20:45,095 --> 00:20:46,095
Sixty.

335
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,595
Looks like I won.

336
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,512
Yeah, but I called in the air strike.

337
00:20:51,595 --> 00:20:52,595
Tie.

338
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:54,053
You're impossible.

339
00:20:54,804 --> 00:20:57,804
I'll never understand
how you can simplify these battles

340
00:20:57,887 --> 00:20:59,261
into some kind of game.

341
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,762
Well, take care of yourselves.

342
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,553
I expect to see both of you back here

343
00:21:05,637 --> 00:21:07,720
by the time I've destroyed
the main factory.

344
00:21:07,804 --> 00:21:09,595
We shall do our best.

345
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,470
Sixty-five, Skywalker.

346
00:21:11,553 --> 00:21:12,887
I'm sorry?

347
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:15,720
My total. 65.

348
00:21:15,804 --> 00:21:17,095
So what do I win?

349
00:21:22,345 --> 00:21:24,637
My everlasting respect, Master Mundi.

350
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,136
Oh.

351
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,387
That is a gift Anakin rarely bestows,
I assure you.

352
00:21:34,053 --> 00:21:36,053
[engines whirring]

353
00:21:41,887 --> 00:21:44,512
[orchestral fanfare]
