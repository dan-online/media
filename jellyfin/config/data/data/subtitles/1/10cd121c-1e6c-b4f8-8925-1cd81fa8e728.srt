on before Denholm comes.</font>

300
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,720
<font size="36">Denholm's coming?!</font>

301
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,040
<font size="36">Yeah, and he's going to fire...
Fire, fire!</font>

302
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,960
<font size="36">I've taken care of it.</font>

303
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,920
<font size="36">I have to say I feel
a little bit insulted</font>

304
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,160
<font size="36">by the lack of faith
you're both displaying.</font>

305
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200
<font size="36">What happened to your feet?!</font>

306
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,400
<font size="36">What is this?</font>

307
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,360
<font size="36">I think a fire in the
office demands a little more
attention than my feet, don't you?!</font>

308
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,360
<font size="36">How did you get the
stress machine, Roy?</font>

309
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,840
<font size="36">Don't really know.</font>

310
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,400
<font size="36">Met Dr Holmes by the lifts.</font>

311
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,080
<font size="36">Wasn't he nice?
I thought he was a lovely man.</font>

312
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,640
<font size="36">Yeah, I thought he was a delight.</font>

313
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:33,880
<font size="36">But I met him there by the
lifts and he just went mental!</font>

314
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,440
<font size="36">Ah-ha...</font>

315
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,560
<font size="36">And one thing led to
another and I just stole it.</font>

316
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,280
<font size="36">You stole it?</font>

317
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,320
<font size="36">Yeah!</font>

318
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,680
<font size="36">But that's stealing!</font>

319
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,720
<font size="36">Yeah. Didn't know what a
stress machine was this morning</font>

320
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,880
<font size="36">and now we have two.</font>

321
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:51,720
<font size="36">I hate to remind everyone
but I just destroyed a merger</font>

322
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,240
<font size="36">that probably took
hundreds of years to set up,</font>

323
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,520
<font size="36">the office is on fire, Denholm is
furious, so could we please</font>

324
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:01,040
<font size="36">concentrate on what's important
and help me on with my shoes?!</font>

325
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,200
<font size="36">We're going to get into trouble!</font>

326
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,120
<font size="36">Empty!</font>

327
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,520
<font size="36">Got a little bit there.</font>

328
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,960
<font size="36">No, these are a size five.</font>

329
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,640
<font size="36">What are you, eight and a half?!</font>

330
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,560
<font size="36">Shut up.</font>

331
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,200
<font size="36">Come on.</font>

332
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:17,840
<font size="36">I'm pushing!</font>

333
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,400
<font size="36">Push it on, don't pull away.</font>

334
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,400
<font size="36">Is it in?!</font>

335
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,800
<font size="36">Come on, push it on. Go on! Woah!</font>

336
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,400
<font size="36">Aaagh! The heel went right through.</font>

337
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,720
<font size="36">Oh my god, it hurts so much!</font>

338
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,640
<font size="36">Oh, God! Oh, now I'm bleeding!</font>

339
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,240
<font size="36">< Jen! Where are you, Jen?</font>

340
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,600
<font size="36">It's Denholm!</font>

341
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,160
<font size="36">What?!</font>

342
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,120
<font size="36">Hide the stress machine!</font>

343
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,200
<font size="36">The stress machine?
What about the fire?!</font>

344
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,200
<font size="36">OK, put the stress machine in Jen's
room. He'll never go in there.</font>

345
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,280
<font size="36">But what if he does?</font>

346
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,600
<font size="36">It doesn't matter,
he won't know what it is!</font>

347
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,280
<font size="36">I can't go to prison, Roy.
They'll rape the flip out of me.</font>

348
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,280
<font size="36">You stall him by the door.</font>

349
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:57,920
<font size="36">How?</font>

350
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,560
<font size="36">I don't know, use your womanly ways!</font>

351
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,920
<font size="36">Moss, pass me that
monitor, the broken one.</font>

352
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,800
<font size="36">There you are.</font>

353
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,240
<font size="36">Hello, there.</font>

354
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,440
<font size="36">It's no use being
womanly with me, Jen.</font>

355
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,080
<font size="36">You're in big trouble.</font>

356
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,920
<font size="36">Nice screensaver.</font>

357
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,480
<font size="36">Thank you.</font>

358
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,080
<font size="36">A-ha! A stress machine!</font>

359
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,720
<font size="36">Just what we need.</font>

360
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,680
<font size="36">Roll up your sleeves, Jen.
Let's get this over with.</font>

361
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,920
<font size="36">It's a one way ticket to
Slammer Town for us, Roy,</font>

362
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,640
<font size="36">with no return ticket.</font>

363
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,760
<font size="36">I really am losing
quite a lot of blood.</font>

364
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,520
<font size="36">This is your last chance.</font>

365
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:49,480
<font size="36">If the needle goes beyond here
you will be fired.</font>

366
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,840
<font size="36">Does that make you feel stressed?
Jen! Does it? No? Are you sure?</font>

367
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,120
<font size="36">Are you sure? Are you sure?</font>

368
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,520
<font size="36">Are you sure?
Are you sure?</font>

369
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,920
<font size="36">Are you sure?
Are you sure?</font>

370
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,920
<font size="36">Are you sure? Are you sure?
Are you sure?</font>

371
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,120
<font size="36">Are you sure?
Are you sure?</font>

372
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,640
<font size="36">I'll level with you, Roy.</font>

373
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,080
<font size="36">I don't think I'd flourish
in a prison environment.</font>

374
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:17,320
<font size="36">Can I try on your glasses?!</font>

375
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,640
<font size="36">See this balloon, Jen?
I'm going to burst it.</font>

376
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:25,760
<font size="36">But I'm not going to tell you when.
Do you feel stressed, Jen? Jen?</font>

377
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,440
<font size="36">Jen? Look at that.</font>

378
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,720
<font size="36">That's your peace of mind
and it's going to go bang.</font>

379
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,480
<font size="36">Do you feel stressed now?
Jen? Jen? Jen?</font>

380
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,280
<font size="36">Jen? Jen? Jen? Do you?</font>

381
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,080
<font size="36">Evidently not.</font>

382
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,200
<font size="36">Well done, Jen.</font>

383
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,160
<font size="36">You're not being fired by me
at this precise moment.</font>

384
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,640
<font size="36">I love the way the smoke seems
to be coming off the top of it.</font>

385
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,840
<font size="36">Just a second...</font>

386
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,800
<font size="36">I'm late for golf!</font>

387
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,320
<font size="36">I wonder why it didn't work.</font>

388
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,560
<font size="36">Ah!</font>

389
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,400
<font size="36">I don't know if
it's the loss of blood</font>

390
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,800
<font size="36">or the melting plastic from
the monitor, but I feel great!</font>

391
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,800
<font size="36">It's ironic, but this entire
situation has been quite stressful.</font>

392
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,560
<font size="36">I'll get help.</font>

393
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,560
<font size="36">Did someone e-mail us about a fire?</font>
