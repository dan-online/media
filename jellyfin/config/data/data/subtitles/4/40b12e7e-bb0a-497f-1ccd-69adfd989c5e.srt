I've got R2.

She engaged General Grievous.

248
00:15:47,595 --> 00:15:48,595
Alone?

249
00:15:48,887 --> 00:15:51,053
She distracted him
while we completed the mission.

250
00:15:51,136 --> 00:15:52,970
It was on her orders, sir.

-The droid was with her.
-We got to find her.

I can take you to her, sir.

What is the matter with you?

254
00:16:06,261 --> 00:16:07,804

It was foolish of you
to take on Grievous by yourself.

Well, I was leading the mission,

He might have mentioned it.
