<font size="36">This programme contains adult humour</font>

00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,040
<font size="36">Which means...
which means a profit so far</font>

3
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,000
<font size="36">this year of 18 hundred billion
billion.</font>

4
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,240
<font size="36">Splendid.</font>

5
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,120
<font size="36">Not including the added revenue
arising from your takeover of ITV.</font>

6
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,240
<font size="36">ITV, I'd forgotten about ITV.</font>

7
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,280
<font size="36">Brilliant!
Gentlemen, when I first started</font>

8
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,160
<font size="36">Renham Industries I had just
two things in my possession...</font>

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,240
<font size="36">Today, I have a business empire
the like of which...</font>

10
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,880
<font size="36">The world has never
seen the like of which.</font>

11
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,640
<font size="36">I hope it doesn't sound
arrogant when I say that I am</font>

12
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,960
<font size="36">the greatest man in the world.</font>

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,360
<font size="36">Hear, hear.</font>

14
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,000
<font size="36">Gentlemen, to the future.</font>

15
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,800
<font size="36">Oh, you don't have any glasses.</font>

16
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,840
<font size="36">Just pretend. The future.</font>

17
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,320
<font size="36">The future.</font>

18
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,760
<font size="36">Sorry to interrupt
but there are some policemen here.</font>

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,280
<font size="36">They say they need to speak
to you about irregularities</font>

20
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,880
<font size="36">in the pension fund.</font>

21
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,480
<font size="36">I see. Could you make them
a cup of tea, please, Stephanie?</font>

22
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,480
<font size="36">Nice.</font>

23
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,640
<font size="36">Isn't she a beauty?</font>

24
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,120
<font size="36">It's certainly a phone.</font>

25
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,360
<font size="36">160 ppi screen, wi-fi enabled...</font>

26
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,000
<font size="36">Ask me what kind of phone I've got.</font>

27
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,280
<font size="36">What kind of phone have you got?</font>

28
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,800
<font size="36">It doesn't matter.</font>

29
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,600
<font size="36">Voice recognition.</font>

30
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,120
<font size="36">So if I wanted
to call my mum, I'd say "mum"</font>

31
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,160
<font size="36">and it calls her. I don't need to
do anything. It's the dog's bollocks.</font>

32
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,160
<font size="36">Hello. Hello.</font>

33
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,520
<font size="36">Oh, no. Mum, mum, no... no I'm sorry.</font>

34
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,840
<font size="36">No, Moss said that.</font>

35
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,680
<font size="36">I'll call you later. Bye.</font>

36
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,560
<font size="36">Only problem with it is that it's
got a very weedy vibrate setting.</font>

37
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,080
<font size="36">I mean it... Watch this.</font>

38
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,080
<font size="36">I mean what is that?</font>

39
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,360
<font size="36">I'll sort it out.</font>

40
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,520
<font size="36">Oh, could you? Just...
welly up the vibrate on it a bit.</font>

41
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,240
<font size="36">OK, all right.
Now will you answer this question?</font>

42
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,520
<font size="36">Oh... are we still on this?</font>

43
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,240
<font size="36">We would have been done ages
ago but you keep interrupting...</font>

44
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,800
<font size="36">All right, all right, OK, go on.</font>

45
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,880
<font size="36">Question 39, when was
the last time you exercised?</font>

46
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,520
<font size="36">Ahh, the last time
I exercised was never.</font>

47
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,600
<font size="36">I'm still reeling
from your answer to question 12.</font>

48
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,600
<font size="36">What was question 12?</font>

49
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,480
<font size="36">You brush your teeth in the bath.</font>

50
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,440
<font size="36">So?</font>

51
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,080
<font size="36">That's where your balls are.</font>

52
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,360
<font size="36">OK, question 40, do you
get your five fruit and veg?</font>

53
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,160
<font size="36">Oohh, oh, I mean I certainly try to.
I would say I prob...I probably do.</font>

54
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,280
<font size="36">A day.</font>

55
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,080
<font size="36">A what?!</font>

56
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,240
<font size="36">OK, you are going to love this.</font>

57
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,480
<font size="36">This website takes all that
information you just gave me</font>

58
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,480
<font size="36">and guess what it does? It actually
estimates the date of your death.</font>

59
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,680
<font size="36">WHAT?!</font>

60
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,480
<font size="36">Unbelievable, isn't it?</font>

61
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,120
<font size="36">Wait a second.</font>

62
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,840
<font size="36">I know about those.
Everyone knows about those.</font>

63
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,320
<font size="36">Oh, right, so you've already
done it. So when's the big day?</font>

64
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,920
<font size="36">No. I haven't done it.
Why would I want to do it?</font>

65
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,160
<font size="36">I go March 2nd, 2079.</font>

66
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,400
<font size="36">Oh, my God.</font>

67
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,200
<font size="36">I've got 70 more years.</font>

68
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,440
<font size="36">OK, Moss, close that window.
I do not wanna know.</font>

69
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,560
<font size="36">But I've written it all in now.</font>

70
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,600
<font size="36">Moss! I do not wanna know
the date of my death.</font>

71
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,120
<font size="36">Close it.</font>

72
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,760
<font size="36">Hello, IT.</font>

73
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,360
<font size="36">Have you tried turning it off... You
know what, I'm sick of saying that.</font>

74
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,760
<font size="36">What do you want?</font>

75
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,000
<font size="36">OK.
Yeah, someone'll be up in a minute.</font>

76
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,600
<font size="36">Maybe.</font>

77
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,320
<font size="36">You looked! You know!</font>

78
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,640
<font size="36">You know when I'm going to die.</font>

79
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,280
<font size="36">I do, yes.</font>

80
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,040
<font size="36">I told you not to look.</font>

81
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,800
<font size="36">I made a mistake.</font>

82
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,840
<font size="36">Oh, aww.</font>

83
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,880
<font size="36">When is it?</font>

84
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,160
<font size="36">You don't wanna know.</font>

85
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,840
<font size="36">You can't say that to me now.</font>

86
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,400
<font size="36">My advice, Roy,
is to forget all about this.</font>

87
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,400
<font size="36">Why, how long have they given me?
20 years?</font>

88
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,960
<font size="36">It's less than 20?</font>

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,720
<font size="36">You see I don't think this is
taking into account leap years</font>

90
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,040
<font size="36">so that could well be
something to hang on to.</font>

91
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,280
<font size="36">What does it say, Moss? Does...</font>

92
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,200
<font size="36">does it say I'm already dead?</font>

93
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,320
<font size="36">Oh, no, that'd be terrible.</font>

94
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,240
<font size="36">It's Thursday.</font>

95
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,440
<font size="36">WHAT?!</font>

96
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,720
<font size="36">It's Thursday.</font>

97
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,640
<font size="36">Thursday?!</font>

98
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,000
<font size="36">Again, remember, leap years.</font>

99
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,440
<font size="36">It's Thursday! Thursday's the 3rd.</font>

100
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,200
<font size="36">Although not till late afternoon
so that gives you most of the day.</font>

101
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,440
<font size="36">3pm.
How can they be that specific?</font>

102
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,040
<font size="36">Yeah. It's silly.</font>

103
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,400
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

104
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,720
<font size="36">These things are at best
79% accurate.</font>

105
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,280
<font size="36">Oh, good.</font>

106
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,560
<font size="36">I would take
no further notice of it.</font>

107
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,560
<font size="36">Yeah.
Yeah, no, you're right. It's silly.</font>

108
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,840
<font size="36">I will take no further notice of it.</font>

109
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,600
<font size="36">There's something wrong
with all the computers on seven.</font>

110
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,280
<font size="36">Who wants it? Roy?</font>

111
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,880
<font size="36">Ohh, you look terrible.
Are you ill?</font>

112
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,440
<font size="36">I don't know.</font>

113
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,960
<font size="36">This idiot's
disabled the flippin' file.</font>

114
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,280
<font size="36">Er, yeah, hello... Excuse me.</font>

115
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,360
<font size="36">Thank you. Um...
some attention, please.</font>

116
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,960
<font size="36">I know you don't think it's
important or cool but there is</font>

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,880
<font size="36">a ruddy good reason why we put up
anti-viral software and firewalls.</font>

118
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,280
<font size="36">It's because there are a lot
of dangerous things out there.</font>

119
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,840
<font size="36">JESUS!</font>

120
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,080
<font size="36">Oh, you know, all right, come down.</font>

121
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,120
<font size="36">Just don't disable the files.</font>

122
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,960
<font size="36">OK, 73, that's good, that's good.</font>

123
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,760
<font size="36">And, um mum,
what age did Uncle Tony die?</font>

124
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,520
<font size="36">32!</font>

125
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,640
<font size="36">Oh, it was a car accident. Brilliant.
OK. No, I completely forgot.</font>

126
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,600
<font size="36">OK. Oh, mum, I have to go.</font>

127
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,840
<font size="36">Unbelievable, some brainiac disabled
his firewall which means that all of</font>

128
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,080
<font size="36">the computers on floor seven are
teaming with viruses, plus I've just</font>

129
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,600
<font size="36">had to walk all the way
down the mother-fudging stairs
because the lift is broken again.</font>

130
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,880
<font size="36">Oh, my God. What?</font>

131
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,520
<font size="36">Oh, my God.</font>

132
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,440
<font size="36">What... What is it?</font>

133
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,440
<font size="36">Denholm's dead.</font>

134
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,600
<font size="36">Oh, yes, and Denholm's dead.</font>

135
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,880
<font size="36">OK, everyone ready?</font>

136
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,920
<font size="36">Wow, you look great.
We should go to more funerals.</font>

137
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,440
<font size="36">Yeah, except is there any chance
that I could not go to this one?</font>

138
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,040
<font size="36">No. why?</font>

139
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,080
<font size="36">It's just, you know, funerals.</font>

140
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,920
<font size="36">So morbid.</font>

141
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,480
<font size="36">Oh, will you please forget
this website nonsense?</font>

142
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,400
<font size="36">You are not going to die.</font>

143
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,320
<font size="36">Come on, cheer up,
you're gonna ruin the funeral.</font>

144
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,400
<font size="36">You're right. Pay no attention to me.</font>

145
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,200
<font size="36">I'm being an idiot.</font>

146
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,800
<font size="36">Dead man walking.</font>

147
