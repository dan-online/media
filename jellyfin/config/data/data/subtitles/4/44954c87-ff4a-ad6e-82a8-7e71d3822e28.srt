CLARKSON:  Tonight,
a BMW i8 at full chat
in the Yorkshire Moors,

00:00:21,667 --> 00:00:23,967
the cream of Hollywood
on our track

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,800
and a pointless thing
about old Land Rovers.

(AUDIENCE CHEERING
AND APPLAUDING)

00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:36,067
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you.

7
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,800
Thank you so much.

8
00:00:38,767 --> 00:00:41,367
Thank you,
and welcome.

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,433
Welcome to what is
for the first time
in many years

10
00:00:45,467 --> 00:00:47,067
an actual car show.

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,967
We've packed it
with mini facts and
a lot of informations.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,733
And we're starting
the ball rolling with this,

13
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:55,467
the Mercedes SLS.

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,833
This was one of my
favourite cars,

15
00:00:57,867 --> 00:01:00,533
and I was very sad
when they stopped making it.

16
00:01:00,567 --> 00:01:03,500
But happily, there is now
a replacement

17
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:06,400
which I haven't been
driving on the track.

18
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:08,900
Because James has.

19
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,433
MAY:  This is what
they've come up with.

20
00:01:18,467 --> 00:01:21,133
It's called the AMG GT,

21
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:28,200
and it costs between
£97,000 and 120,000.

22
00:01:33,933 --> 00:01:36,533
Now, I have to be
entirely honest with you.

23
00:01:36,567 --> 00:01:37,833
When I woke up this morning

24
00:01:37,867 --> 00:01:40,333
and got out of bed
to come and drive this car,

25
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:42,467
it was with
a certain amount of disquiet.

26
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:48,100
I've always thought that
AMG Mercedes are a bit,

27
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:50,900
as my mother would say,
unnecessary.

28
00:01:53,067 --> 00:01:56,433
I don't like the Stormtrooper
body kit look.

29
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:01,567
I don't really like those
pseudo Special Forces names

30
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,067
like "SLS" and "Black."

31
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:07,200
Jeremy likes them a lot.

32
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:16,500
With this car, however,
you sense that something
is different,

33
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:19,467
that everything's
a bit more grown up.

34
00:02:22,367 --> 00:02:25,933
See, their last coupe,
the SLS, had a massive,

35
00:02:25,967 --> 00:02:28,167
and again,
not entirely necessary,

36
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,267
6.2-litre V8.

37
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,733
This car also has a V8,
but it's a brand-new one.

38
00:02:33,767 --> 00:02:37,133
And it's a
much more modest 4 litres.

39
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:38,900
Because of that,
you might expect it

40
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:41,867
to take a little longer
to get from A to B.

41
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,067
However...

42
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:48,067
(ENGINE REVVING)

43
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,800
The nought to 60 time
of that 6.2-litre SLS
was 3.8 seconds.

44
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:02,067
On this,
the 4-litre car, it is...

45
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:05,067
Exactly the same.

46
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,433
The top speeds are almost
exactly the same as well,

47
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:10,267
both up in the high 190s.

48
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,433
Brute.

49
00:03:16,467 --> 00:03:21,067
And AMG has achieved this
by using brains to make
the brawn.

50
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:26,067
This car has
two turbochargers.

51
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:29,933
Normally, turbochargers
would be bolted onto
the outside of the engines,

52
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:33,967
but on this car, they live
inside the V of the engine.

53
00:03:34,067 --> 00:03:37,633
What this means is
the engine is more compact

54
00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:39,500
and the turbos
are more efficient.

55
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:46,067
So, this car costs
£50,000 less than the old SLS.

56
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:48,233
It uses a lot less fuel.

57
00:03:48,267 --> 00:03:50,400
And it still goes
just as quickly.

58
00:03:52,067 --> 00:03:55,800
That is what they call
on  The Apprentice "a win-win."

59
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,867
And then there's the styling,
which also has a new level
of sophistication,

60
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,267
with an interior that's
more James Bond
than Fast & Furious.

61
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,067
On the outside,
it's much the same story.

62
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:19,433
These doors are
perfectly conventional

63
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:21,633
in-and-out sort of doors.

64
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:25,267
They're not like those
idiotic gull-wing things
you get on the SLS

65
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,067
which makes it look as if
it's sniffing its own armpits.

66
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,300
This rear spoiler
is actually an option.

67
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:34,067
But even that,
by AMG standards,
is quite discreet.

68
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:38,267
In fact, the whole thing
is quite pretty.

69
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,933
Quite classic, even.

70
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:46,267
And now we must
move onto cornering,

71
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,900
an activity where
AMG normally scores
maximum points for mentalness.

72
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,967
This is,
when all's said and done,

73
00:04:55,067 --> 00:04:59,133
a 503 horsepower
rear-wheel-drive muscle car,

74
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:03,267
and that sounds like a recipe
for extreme trickiness.

75
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,833
In fact, you can corner
quickly in this thing,

76
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:09,800
and without soiling
your trousers.

77
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:16,267
Which, one again, is thanks
to intelligent engineering.

78
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,800
In a normal car,
the engine and the gearbox,

79
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,067
they're just dead weight
hanging in there,

80
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:25,233
and they move around a bit,
and sort of spoil the balance
as you go around corners.

81
00:05:25,267 --> 00:05:29,233
In this car, the mountings for
all that stuff are active.

82
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:33,567
So, as you go through a bend,
they stiffen up to keep
all that weight in check.

83
00:05:35,567 --> 00:05:38,900
It's a bit like the way
a cat can walk along
the top of a fence

84
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:41,933
using its tail to keep
itself in balance.

85
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:45,400
However, if, like Jeremy,

86
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:48,233
you want to devour your
back tyres in one sitting,

87
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,967
you still can.

I hate it when
my prejudices are demolished,

95
00:06:21,567 --> 00:06:23,600
but this car
is giving me the fizz.

96
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:31,500
What I like most of all
is that the GT is
cleverly designed

97
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:34,600
to be Jekyll and Hyde.

98
00:06:34,633 --> 00:06:36,300
I'm just gonna
quieten it down.

99
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:39,467
Turn off the manual change,
the noisy exhaust.

100
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,633
We'll put it back
into comfort mode.

Comfort suspension.
There you go.

102
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:46,067
When you turn all that off,

103
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:51,500
it turns into this
incredibly civilised,
long-legged cruiser.

104
00:06:53,667 --> 00:06:55,300

105
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:57,967
They've got rid of
the Andy McNab names
and all that nonsense

106
00:06:58,067 --> 00:07:01,867
and they've given us
an AMG for grownups.

-with this one, though.
-What?

Well, firstly,
it reminds me of you.

116

The second one is,
let's be honest,

117
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:35,867
for not much more than
half the price of this,

118
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,167

a Nissan GT-R,

119
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,067

120
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,300
is the finest car
in the world.

what we'll do.

We'll sort it out
on the track, okay?

We'll see how fast
this one can get round.

00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,933
That's quicker than
the old SLS Black.

170
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:51,467
And, ahem, quicker than
the Nissan GT-R,

171
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,167
which shows, James,
that you don't know
what you're talking about.

172
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,467
Interesting.

173
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,933
Didn't actually feel like it
would be that fast

174
00:09:57,967 --> 00:09:59,300
when I was driving it,
to be honest.

175
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,700
No, that's because...
Yeah, you were driving it.

176
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:03,167
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

177
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,667
Right, and now we must
do the news.

178
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,733
And we start with big news.

179
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:10,733
This is the biggest news
we've had in a long time,
I would say,

180
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:14,367
because Ford
for the very first time

181
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,900
is making the Mustang
in right-hand drive

182
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:19,700
and will be bringing it
to the UK officially.

183
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:21,433
You can buy them over here.
There it is.

184
00:10:21,467 --> 00:10:25,700
Two versions. You can have
four-cylinder EcoBoost
for £28,000,

185
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:28,433
or for £33,000,
a five-litre V8.

186
00:10:28,467 --> 00:10:30,233
Mmm, the one I want,
though, is the Shelby.

187
00:10:30,267 --> 00:10:33,067
The 350 GTR,
or something like that.

188
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,933
It's a 520-horsepower V8.

189
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,567
That's the one.
There it is. Look.

190
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,367
HAMMOND:
Yeah, it looks brilliant.
But you can't.

191
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,833
They're not bringing
that one here.

192
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:41,500
-They're not selling
that one to us.
-Why?

193
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:43,033
It is going to Canada
in a year.

194
00:10:43,067 --> 00:10:44,400
Yeah, I know,
but so is the Internet,
but that's...

195
00:10:44,433 --> 00:10:46,733
Yeah, but that's
not coming here.
No, we can't...

196
00:10:46,767 --> 00:10:48,733
-Why won't they sell it to us?
-I don't know.

197
00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:52,900
But you must be very looking
forward to a right-hand-drive
Mustang, Richard Hammond.

198
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:55,033
Yeah, you think.
No, not really.

199
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:57,967
Because I don't want
a right-hand-drive Mus...

200
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,667
Once it becomes
right-hand-drive,

201
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,067
it's like it's trying
too hard to be British
and sophisticated

202
00:11:04,067 --> 00:11:05,433
and something it's not.

203
00:11:05,467 --> 00:11:07,667
I know it. It's like when
Americans come over here

204
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,467
and start using words
like "bloody".

205
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,833
-Isn't it?
-Yes, it's exactly that.

206
00:11:11,867 --> 00:11:13,067
It is, and they say,

207
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:14,833
"I'm going to the bloody pub."

208
00:11:14,867 --> 00:11:15,967
Yeah, it doesn't sound right.

209
00:11:16,067 --> 00:11:17,867
-And that's...
-Exactly, it is.

210
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,267
Or they say "mate".

211
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,967
They try and say "mate"
when it just doesn't work.

212
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:22,700
Yes, 'cause they think
that we're Crocodile Dundee.

213
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:25,100
-It's all the same 'cause
they haven't got atlases.
-Yeah.

214
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:27,867
So that, realistically,
should be called,
now it's coming here,

215
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,567
the Ford Bloody Quid, Mate.

216
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,733
-Yeah.
-That's its name.

217
00:11:31,767 --> 00:11:35,333
Ooh, now. Can I just do...
Can I just do a survey?

218
00:11:35,367 --> 00:11:38,667
How many people here
enjoyed the ambulance film
we did last week?

219
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,267
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

220
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,067
Okay, you see,
the problem we have

221
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:44,767
is that we've had an
electronic communication

222
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,700
from a man called
Mr E36Man4000, who says,

223
00:11:49,733 --> 00:11:51,167
"Dear so-called  Top Gear,

224
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,533
"I hated your thing
on ambulances.

225
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:55,100
"Why don't you stick to cars?"

226
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,933
Shall we show Mr...

227
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:59,067
What's he called?
Mr Hashtag...

228
00:11:59,067 --> 00:12:00,667
Shall we show him what
this show would be like

229
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,333
if we just talked about cars?

230
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:03,933
-Yeah, all right.
-Sure.

231
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,700
I'll tell you what
I drove this week,

232
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:12,567
Volkswagen Passat Diesel.

233
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,867
-Did you?
-Mmm.

234
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,867
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

235
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,200
-And?
-Surprisingly comfortable.

236
00:12:20,967 --> 00:12:23,300
I also drove an Audi TT.

237
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,167
Which is much nicer
than you'd think.

238
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,933
Okay.

239
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:33,300
Actually, I've been driving
the new Porsche 911 Turbo,

240
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:34,700
which is very fast,

241
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:37,233
but surprisingly quiet.

242
00:12:37,267 --> 00:12:38,633
-Is it?
-Yep.

243
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:40,067
Mmm-hmm.

244
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,867
(SMACKS LIPS) Ah.

245
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,133
Um, Aston Martin

246
00:12:45,167 --> 00:12:47,833
have built a new one-off
for a Bond film.

247
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,300
It's called the DB10.

248
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,367
CLARKSON: Yep.
AUDIENCE: (SOFTLY) Ooh.

249
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,067
I don't think much
of that, actually.

250
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,867
-I don't like
the way it looks.
-No, I don't.

251
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,100
-No, I do.
-Okay.

252
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:58,667
Erm, Vauxhall has a new car,

253
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,400
-the Corsa.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

254
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:03,633
I've got nothing on that.

255
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,800
Shall we give up
on car news?

256
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,233
I'm going to take charge again

257
00:13:09,267 --> 00:13:11,200
'cause I want to talk about
something else, right?

258
00:13:11,233 --> 00:13:14,067
I want to talk about
some experts

259
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,167
who said last week
they wanted to rip up all
of Britain's railway lines,

260
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,367
replace them with motorways

261
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,267
that would then only
be used by coaches.

262
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,067
And I think
that'd be a shame.

263
00:13:23,067 --> 00:13:24,500
Why would that be a shame?

264
00:13:24,533 --> 00:13:26,500
-Because I like having
coaches on motorways.
-Why?

265
00:13:26,533 --> 00:13:30,467
Because you can
drive alongside them
and use their Wi-Fi.

266
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,833
Can you? Can we just...

267
00:13:32,867 --> 00:13:34,867
You can, obviously.
You all don't know?

268
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,633
It's fabulous.
My kids always say,

269
00:13:36,667 --> 00:13:37,967
"Daddy, Daddy,
slow down to 70."

270
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,533
I mean, sorry,
"Speed up to 70.

271
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:42,100
"Catch the coach quickly

272
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:44,967
"so we can Snapchat
this picture of a poo
I've done."

273
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:48,367
So it's like a free
roaming Wi-Fi?

274
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,700
Exactly.

275
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:52,100
You do it on the way home.
It's incredibly cheap.

276
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:54,200
Now, a few years ago,
we improved police cars,

277
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:56,700
and last week,
we improved ambulances.

278
00:13:56,733 --> 00:13:59,167
Yes, we did. We are now
the emergency service

279
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,967
for the emergency services.

280
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:03,167
Yeah, we are. Well, we are.
It's up to us.

281
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,733
Quite a lot of people have
written to us, and they said,

282
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:06,833
"Right, when are you gonna
improve fire engines?"

283
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:09,133
Hmm.

284
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:12,067
No, actually, ooh, yeah,
we've looked into this
and there's a problem.

285
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,767
Because if you have to build
a vehicle that's big enough
for all the water you need

286
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,067
and pumps and ladders
and buckets

287
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:19,833
and six burly men

288
00:14:19,867 --> 00:14:22,200
and women in wellingtons,

289
00:14:22,233 --> 00:14:24,567
what you end up with
is a fire engine.

290
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,300
-Yeah.
-But specifically,
a British fire engine.

291
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:30,067
-That's important.
-Yeah, not one of those
stupid American ones

292
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:32,433
-where all the firemen
stand on the outside.
-They do.

293
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:35,267
So you get there and
there's nobody onboard
to put the fire out.

294
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,433
You know what I like
about the British fire engine?

295
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:39,867
It says Dennis on the front.

296
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,467
(LAUGHS) That's the name.

297
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,267
Dennis is a reassuring name.

298
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,733
And Dennis would remember
to return your lawnmower.

299
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:49,467
It is interesting, actually,
because American fire engines

300
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,267
have really stupid...

301
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,100
I've got a picture of
an American fire engine here.

302
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:54,633
Guess what that's called.

303
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:55,767
CLARKSON: Fire engine.

304
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,100
No, it's called the Igniter.

305
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:00,467
-HAMMOND: What?
-It is.

306
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,600
I mean, how does...
"I've already got a fire."

307
00:15:03,633 --> 00:15:05,600
Exactly. It should be called
the Extinguisher.

308
00:15:05,633 --> 00:15:08,133
It's like they've probably
got an ambulance called
the Haemorrhage.

309
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:09,700
Yes.

310
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:13,500
Right, earlier on,
James had a go
at a proper road test

311
00:15:13,533 --> 00:15:15,267
in our one-off car show,

312
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,067
and now it's my turn.

313
00:15:17,067 --> 00:15:19,333
-Try not to muck it up.
-No, no, no, relax.

314
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:21,833
This is going to be
a blizzard of facts

315
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:26,100
because I'm gonna talk
about the new BMW M3.

316
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:30,100
It has a smaller engine
than the old model.

317
00:15:30,133 --> 00:15:31,767
Three litres rather than four.

318
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,900
It has two fewer cylinders,

319
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,733
but it's turbocharged,

320
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:37,700
so you get a little bit
more horsepower

321
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:40,500
and 111 more torques.

322
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:45,733
That means it's four seconds
a lap faster round our track

323
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:46,867
than the old car.

324
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,067
And four seconds
is a huge goal,

325
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:51,633
because, remember,
that was already

326
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:54,800
five seconds a lap faster
round the Ascari track
in Spain

327
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,967
than the equivalent Mercedes
and Audi.

328
00:15:57,067 --> 00:15:59,500
So this is properly quick,

329
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:00,933
and it's more economical,

330
00:16:00,967 --> 00:16:03,400
but, and this is
the big one,

331
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:05,267
is it nicer to drive?

332
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:14,900
CLARKSON:  Well, here it is,
slithering about on our track.

333
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:21,467
Look at that.
I mean, that's just

(IMITATING CAR WHOOSHING)

335
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:26,867
But straightaway,
I must tell you
there's a bit of a niggle.

336
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,067
If you stick the tail
out in a corner,

337
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:33,700
which you can, easily,
because it's an M3,

338
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:37,533
you'll find it very hard
to hold the drift

339
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:41,067
because the power steering
is now electric

340
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,100
rather than hydraulic.

341
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:46,667
Going around
a corner like this

342
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,467
is like wrestling
with the tail of an
excitable crocodile.

343
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,600
It's not just hard
to hold the slide,

344
00:16:52,633 --> 00:16:56,433
it's also hard to
straighten up again
afterwards.

Ever, if I'm honest.

349
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:09,400
And anyway, you can solve it

350
00:17:09,433 --> 00:17:13,067
by taking the steering
out of Sport Plus mode

351
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,533
and putting it
in Comfort mode.

352

155 miles an hour,

and 134 miles to the gallon.

And because
it's so economical,

you get a £5,000 grant
from the government

it's exempt from
the London Congestion Charge,

387
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,567
and the road tax bill,
as you can see here, is nil.

388
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,367

like this car answers
everyone's prayers.

I've chosen Whitby is,

403
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:33,333
A, you get the best
fish and chips
in the world there,

404
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:37,300
and B, the M3
we saw earlier
is waiting for me there,

405
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:42,067
which means, when I arrive,
I will face a simple choice.

406
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:46,300
Will I want to drive home
in that or this?

407
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:53,200
With the satnav looking for
the most economical
route to Whitby,

408
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:55,833
I put my sensible head on
and settled down

409
00:20:55,867 --> 00:20:59,200
for a 200-mile
fact-finding mission.

410
00:21:01,267 --> 00:21:05,100
You have a choice of
three driving modes.

411
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:09,800
Number one,
electric drive, that's
the electric motor only.

412
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:12,100
It gives you
a range of 20 miles,

413
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:14,367
19 more than
you get from a Prius,

414
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,600
and probably enough
for you to do your
morning commute.

415
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:23,100
Then, if you move
the gear lever over here,
you engage sport mode.

416
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:25,767
That means the electric motor
and the petrol engine

417
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:29,400
are working together
to give 352 horsepower,

418
00:21:29,433 --> 00:21:33,200
and it makes the car
sort of firm and bitey
and Nurburgringy.

419
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:42,233
But since we are on the A1,
I shall go for comfort mode.

420
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,533
Lovely.

421
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:48,333
And it really was lovely.

00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:52,067
I know there's an
electric motor in the front,

423
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:56,100
driving the front wheels
through a two-speed
automatic gearbox.

424
00:21:56,133 --> 00:21:58,433
I know there's
a petrol engine at the back,

425
00:21:58,467 --> 00:22:02,867
driving the rear wheels
through a six-speed
automatic gearbox.

426
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,600
I also know there's another
small electric motor
at the back

and doing all sorts
of clever things.

So I am not.

I can either drive along
without the batteries,

or I can put
the gear lever over here

charged up as I drive along.

What's more, in sport mode,
the i8 is properly fast.

I scoffed when BMW said
they were gonna make a hybrid

473
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,467
that was as fast as a 911
or a Chevrolet Corvette,

00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,400
but it really is.

475
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,933

I was in the North.

00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:03,833
This is Doncaster.
This is where I grew up.

477
00:25:03,867 --> 00:25:06,800
It was a mining town
back then, but now look.

It's a wind farm.

479
00:25:10,067 --> 00:25:12,433
A bit less romantic,
the windmills.

480
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:18,100
And they employ fewer people,
but time moves on, I guess.

481
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,700
So far, then,
the i8 had done well.

482
00:25:22,733 --> 00:25:27,233
But to find out
if it could truly win the
heart of the petrolhead,

483
00:25:27,267 --> 00:25:29,733

and plunged into

This is a revelation!

00:26:13,233 --> 00:26:17,067
It's the lightness
that staggers you most of all.

489
00:26:17,067 --> 00:26:20,900
It's almost as though
I'm steering using
nothing but thought.

490
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,933
And because
the heavy battery pack

491
00:26:24,967 --> 00:26:29,067
is located in the middle
of the car, here low down,

492
00:26:29,067 --> 00:26:33,533
it has the same
centre of gravity as a worm.

00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:38,733
Couple that to the
four-wheel-drive system,

494
00:26:38,767 --> 00:26:41,067
and honestly,
you can go around any corner

495
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:44,333
at any speed
that takes your fancy.

496
00:26:45,867 --> 00:26:51,633

the faster I drive,
the sharper I brake,

00:26:51,667 --> 00:26:55,500
the more electricity
I'm making for the battery.

498
00:26:56,667 --> 00:26:58,567
If you get busted
for speeding in this car,

499
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,267
you get a thank-you letter
from Greenpeace.

500
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,533
And rightly so.

501
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,600
But before we get
carried away with this
environmental stuff,

502
00:27:07,633 --> 00:27:11,400
there's one important point
we all need to remember.

503
00:27:13,567 --> 00:27:17,600
I've always had a fundamental
problem with hybrids.

504
00:27:18,433 --> 00:27:20,767
And it's this.

505
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,567
We all know the world
has limited resources

506
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,433
and we must do all we can
to eke them out.

507
00:27:27,467 --> 00:27:30,100
And you're not gonna do that
if you drive around in a car

508
00:27:30,133 --> 00:27:33,067
that has, effectively,
two engines.

509
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,900
You don't solve the problem
of conspicuous consumption

510
00:27:35,933 --> 00:27:40,500
by using
conspicuous consumption.

511
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:44,067
The thing is, though,
while you have to
rape the world

512
00:27:44,067 --> 00:27:45,300
to make a car like that,

513
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:47,933
the benefits of owning one
for you and I

514
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:50,367
in the here and now
are immense.

515
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,967
Because that car...

516
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
That car is staggering.

517
00:27:55,733 --> 00:27:57,133
It's breathtaking.

518
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,567
It's nearly as breathtaking
as that view.

519
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,067
With the advert
for Yorkshire over,
I got back on the road.

520
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,067
It is incredible to think
that I am now cruising

521
00:28:18,067 --> 00:28:22,400
into Whitby
in silent, electric mode,

522
00:28:22,433 --> 00:28:24,800
using electricity that I made

523
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:27,600
by driving
quickly on the Moors.

524
00:28:27,633 --> 00:28:31,233
The message really is
very clear from this car.

525
00:28:31,267 --> 00:28:34,967
If you wanna save the planet,
drive fast.

526
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:51,067
After a short eco drive
through the pretty
fishing port of Whitby,

527
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:56,967
I arrived in the harbour,
where I faced a very
difficult choice.

528
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,467
Cod or haddock?

529
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,600
I think cod.

530
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,167
Then I faced
an even more difficult choice.

531
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,967
Which of these cars
would I drive back to London?

532
00:29:15,067 --> 00:29:21,633
This is the hardest decision
I've ever had to make
between cars. Ever.

533
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:27,067
It's like the M3 is the best
of where we've come from

534
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:31,433
and the i8 is
where we're going.

535
00:29:31,467 --> 00:29:34,367
There must have been
a moment in history

536
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,067
when everybody
had typewriters,

537
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,500
and typewriters had
been around hundreds of years
and they were brilliant,

538
00:29:40,533 --> 00:29:43,167
and then somebody
came along with a laptop.

539
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,333
That is what's going on there.

540
00:29:52,067 --> 00:29:54,300
No, I've made my mind up.

541
00:30:06,533 --> 00:30:08,200
Bet you weren't
expecting that.

542
00:30:16,467 --> 00:30:19,200
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING
AND APPLAUDING)
-CLARKSON: Thank you.

543
00:30:19,233 --> 00:30:22,133
(CLARKSON SPEAKING
INDISTINCTLY)

544
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:24,233
-What?
-Hold on, hold on, hold on.

545
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:26,567
Let me make sure
I've got this straight.

546
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,233
You, let's be honest,
are our resident dinosaur.

547
00:30:29,267 --> 00:30:33,000
-I am.
-And you prefer
the i8 to the M3.

548
00:30:33,033 --> 00:30:33,933
No.

549
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:35,467
But in the film...

550
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,800
Yes, I know.
I was wrong.

551
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:40,733
Thing is, I've had
some time to do some
thinking since then,

552
00:30:40,767 --> 00:30:43,967
and there are one or two
bits and bobs on the i8
that would drive you mad.

553
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,433
I mean,
rear visibility is atrocious.

554
00:30:46,467 --> 00:30:47,800
The boot's microscopic.

555
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:49,200
This window doesn't go
all the way down,

556
00:30:49,233 --> 00:30:51,567
so you can't drive along
with your arm hanging out.

557
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,133
And I discovered last week

558
00:30:53,167 --> 00:30:56,700
that an i8 has just been
bought by Wayne Rooney.

559
00:30:56,733 --> 00:30:58,900
-Oh, no. No.
-Oh.

560
00:30:58,933 --> 00:31:00,233
And it gets worse.

561
00:31:00,267 --> 00:31:02,600
Well, how can it get
worse than that?

562
00:31:02,633 --> 00:31:05,067
Because in a laboratory
in Munich,

563
00:31:05,067 --> 00:31:07,733
it can do 134 miles
to the gallon.

564
00:31:07,767 --> 00:31:10,867
But have a guess
how many miles to
the gallon I averaged.

565
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,667
-Em, 80.
-Nope.

566
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,800
79.

567
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:15,367
No.

568
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,433
-78.
-No, James.

569
00:31:17,467 --> 00:31:21,233
-I averaged 31 miles
to the gallon.
-HAMMOND: Oh.

570
00:31:21,267 --> 00:31:24,367
And other i8 owners
are reporting the same
sort of thing.

571
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,600
And it only has
a tiny little fuel tank.

572
00:31:26,633 --> 00:31:28,233
Seven gallons.

573
00:31:28,267 --> 00:31:30,833
Which means you're
gonna be stopping
for fuel all the time.

574
00:31:30,867 --> 00:31:33,567
So when you said
it's a laptop,

575
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,600
-it's one of those really
early days laptop.
-It is.

576
00:31:35,633 --> 00:31:38,233
They're on the right road,
make no mistake about that.

577
00:31:38,267 --> 00:31:40,500
But they are not there
just yet.

578
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,767
So anyway, let's move on.

579
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,067
Let's put a star in our
reasonably-priced car.

580
00:31:46,067 --> 00:31:49,400
Now my guest tonight
was Jordan Belfort's wife
in  The Wold of Wall Street,

581
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:52,600
one of my favourite films
of the modern age.

582
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:54,633
She's now in a new film

583
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:56,900
and she's brought along
her co-star.

584
00:31:56,933 --> 00:31:58,867
So please welcome
Margot Robbie

585
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,733
and a man called Will Smith!

-Yeah!

588
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,100
look what we got for you.

589
00:32:10,133 --> 00:32:12,067
Yeah, we got you as well.

590
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,600
-SMITH: Good to see you.
-Good to see you too. Welcome.

591
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:17,100
Margot, I'll go round here

592
00:32:17,133 --> 00:32:19,267
ROBBIE: Thanks for having us.
SMITH: What's up, everybody.

593
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,433
And relax.

594
00:32:20,467 --> 00:32:21,567
Hey!

595
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:24,833
CLARKSON: Have a seat.

596
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,400
Have a seat.

597
00:32:27,433 --> 00:32:29,367
This is fantastic.

598
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,633
-CLARKSON: Is it
really, really fantastic?
-Wow. This is great.

599
00:32:31,667 --> 00:32:34,967
'Cause I was gonna begin
by apologising for the
trailers we have.

600
00:32:35,067 --> 00:32:36,900
The trailers?
Oh, those trailers.

601
00:32:36,933 --> 00:32:38,167
-Yeah.
-They're really nice.

602
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,600
You know, uh...

603
00:32:39,633 --> 00:32:42,267
Will set his bar very high
with trailers, though, so...

604
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,067
-Really?
-Yeah, his trailer's pimped.

605
00:32:45,067 --> 00:32:47,067
Yeah, I'm very serious
about the trailer.

606
00:32:47,067 --> 00:32:49,100
The trailer, you know,
it has to be like...

607
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,300
You know,
you gotta hook it up.

608
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:51,967
-You gotta have
a stereo system.
-Mmm-hmm.

609
00:32:52,067 --> 00:32:54,067
-You know, it has to...
-He also had mirrors
on the roof.

610
00:32:54,733 --> 00:32:55,767
Very cool.

611
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,800
(MOUTHING)

612
00:32:57,833 --> 00:32:59,467
I'm not insinuating anything.

613
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,167
I'm just saying. (LAUGHS)

614
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,700
That's gonna get in trouble.

615
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:05,667
That's gonna get into trouble.

616
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,800
Already in trouble there,
my mind's gone.

618
00:33:10,067 --> 00:33:12,600
No, 'cause really
not that long ago,
you were in  Neighbours.

619
00:33:12,633 --> 00:33:14,700
-Yeah.
-What interests me
about  Neighbours,

620
00:33:14,733 --> 00:33:17,500
-which is an Aussie TV...
-I know what  Neighbours is.

621
00:33:17,533 --> 00:33:19,233
Don't pretend you know.

622
00:33:19,267 --> 00:33:21,800
-I know what  Neighbours is.
-Two days ago,
they asked him

623
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,100
what show I did in Australia.
Very popular show.

624
00:33:24,133 --> 00:33:25,800
And you said
it started with C.

625
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:27,900
I couldn't remember the name.

626
00:33:27,933 --> 00:33:29,267
There's no C in it.

627
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,067
I just can't see Will Smith
finishing it that way.

628
00:33:31,067 --> 00:33:32,367
"Do you know what?
I think I'm watching
Neighbours."

629
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,967
-(LAUGHS)
-Oh, it's 6:30.
My show's on.

630
00:33:35,067 --> 00:33:37,433
And Russell Crowe
started in that, didn't he?

631
00:33:37,467 --> 00:33:39,200
-Mmm.
-And then Guy Pearce
was in another one.

632
00:33:39,233 --> 00:33:40,767
-Kylie's in another one.
-Yeah. Yeah.

633
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,800
And I was wondering,
did you know
Coronation Street?

634
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:44,067
'Cause that's
produced literally...

635
00:33:44,067 --> 00:33:45,700
Yeah, yeah, I know
all those shows, man.

636
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:47,833
You don't.
And you won't because...

637
00:33:47,867 --> 00:33:49,933
I got the DVDs and everything.

638
00:33:51,567 --> 00:33:53,267
It is just unbelievable.

639
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,067
I have all those...

640
00:33:55,067 --> 00:33:57,933
The  Coronation Street
and  Neighbours and all those.

641
00:33:57,967 --> 00:34:00,433
East Enders. Yeah.

642
00:34:00,467 --> 00:34:04,067
Now you're over here
to promote a film.

643
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,367
-Yes.
-It's called  Focus,

644
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,267
but it isn't about
the small Ford hatchback.

645
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:11,667
-No. (LAUGHS)
-Disappointed,
some people in here.

646
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:15,067
Well, it's a love story
between you two,
which is rather sweet.

647
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,900
It's interesting. It's...

648
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:21,133
My character plays a conman,

649
00:34:21,167 --> 00:34:23,067
a master thief.

650
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,867
And part of
being a master thief
is he's a liar.

651
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:30,633
And he meets
Margot's character, Jess,

652
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:32,767
and falls madly in love,

653
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,600
and realises quickly
that lying and loving
don't go together to well.

654
00:34:37,633 --> 00:34:38,967
They go together often,

655
00:34:39,067 --> 00:34:41,933
but they don't go
together well.

656
00:34:41,967 --> 00:34:43,733
I believe we have a clip,

657
00:34:43,767 --> 00:34:45,900
-which we will show now.
-Really? Okay.

663
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:55,767
JESS:  I am going to kill you.

664
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,933
Kill me later.

665
00:34:58,067 --> 00:35:00,067
You lost everyone's money,
my money.

666
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:00,967
Hey!

667
00:35:01,067 --> 00:35:02,233
-Wow.
-Wow.

668
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,267
This is your mess!

669
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,300
JESS:  I think
you're losing it.

670
00:35:06,333 --> 00:35:07,467
Whoa! Whoa!

671
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,667
Then why'd you come up here?

672
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,600
Professional curiosity.

673
00:35:10,633 --> 00:35:13,500
And I like boobs. You know,
I figured it was a win-win.

674
00:35:13,533 --> 00:35:14,800
Ohh!

675
00:35:16,567 --> 00:35:19,533
NICKY:  At the end of the day,
this is a game of focus.

676
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,300
Yeah.

677
00:35:27,067 --> 00:35:29,767
Did you notice?
When I had my shirt off,
you noticed, didn't you?

678
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,967
Did you see that shot?

679
00:35:31,967 --> 00:35:33,200
Yes, that's what
everyone took away.

680
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:34,967
I just want to know
if you saw the shot?

681
00:35:35,067 --> 00:35:36,700
Margot had her
trousers off.

682
00:35:36,733 --> 00:35:38,200
Oh, yes. You saw that.

683
00:35:38,233 --> 00:35:40,767
-Slightly more distracting.
-I get that. I get that.

684
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,633
And I've seen you in those
shirts on a million times

685
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:45,300
-but... Well, I have seen...
-Well.

686
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:46,600
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

687
00:35:48,733 --> 00:35:50,567
CLARKSON:
I never seen you in those.

688
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,500
-(LAUGHS)
-This just got awkward.

689
00:35:52,533 --> 00:35:54,300
-It did.
-(LAUGHS)

690
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:56,133
Now one of the things that
make it even more awkward

691
00:35:56,167 --> 00:35:59,600
is you filmed quite
a lot of the movie
in Argentina.

692
00:35:59,633 --> 00:36:01,267
Yes. Yeah. Mmm.

693
00:36:03,567 --> 00:36:04,800
How did that go for you?

694
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:06,767
For me? It was good.

695
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,433
It was good, man.
Argentina's fantastic.

696
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,800
-Is it?
-(MUTTERS)

697
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,200
-Uh-oh.
-What's wrong with Argentina?

698
00:36:14,233 --> 00:36:15,867
What's wrong with Argentina?
What happened?

699
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,267
Every fucking thing.

700
00:36:19,933 --> 00:36:21,900
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

701
00:36:24,833 --> 00:36:27,400
No, but it is.
Well, I enjoyed it,
and best of luck with it.

702
00:36:27,433 --> 00:36:29,100
-Thank you, man.
-When does it open?

703
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:30,433
27th.

704
00:36:30,467 --> 00:36:31,800
-27th...
-February 27th.

705
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:33,067
Is it 27th here?

706
00:36:33,067 --> 00:36:35,667
-Yes, okay. Yes.
-ROBBIE: Yeah.

707
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,167
CLARKSON: Now,
we got to get on to cars

708
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,400
-'cause you grew up
on a farm in Australia.
-Mmm.

709
00:36:39,433 --> 00:36:43,167
So you presumably
been driving since
you were nought

710
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,267
'cause it's such a vast area.

711
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,267
Yeah, it's huge.

712
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:50,067
But, yeah, in our family
the rule was we could drive
as soon as you could, like,

713
00:36:50,067 --> 00:36:51,900
you know, physically
reach the pedals.

714
00:36:51,933 --> 00:36:55,667
And you could have the car
on your own when you
reached double digits.

715
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,967
-So when you were 10,
you were allowed to...
-SMITH: Wow.

716
00:36:59,067 --> 00:37:01,533
-And I remember being,
like, 9 years old...
-Little children at home.

717
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:03,833
...and arguing
with the parents,
being like,

718
00:37:03,867 --> 00:37:06,067
"Guys, this is absurd.
I'm not, like..."

719
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,200
And they're like,
"No, you're 9. You have
to wait another year."

720
00:37:08,233 --> 00:37:09,767
And I was like, "This is...

721
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,900
"I can't believe this.
This is ridiculous."

722
00:37:11,933 --> 00:37:13,300
Have you been out
to the Outback?

723
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:15,067
The out... No, no, no.

724
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:17,333
I feel like
you'd fit right in.
You'd love it.

725
00:37:17,367 --> 00:37:18,533
See, it's a racial thing.
You went racial.

726
00:37:18,567 --> 00:37:20,600
-Yeah, it is. Yeah.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

727
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,500
(LAUGHING)

728
00:37:26,767 --> 00:37:28,333
And so, what was
your first car?

729
00:37:28,367 --> 00:37:29,833
It was, ahem,

730
00:37:29,867 --> 00:37:32,833
a candy apple red IROC Z.

731
00:37:32,867 --> 00:37:34,433
A Camaro.

732
00:37:34,467 --> 00:37:36,333
-Apparently, you don't
have those here.
-No, we don't. No.

733
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:38,400
We have, what's the word,
uh, taste.

734
00:37:38,433 --> 00:37:40,067
(LAUGHTER)

735
00:37:41,367 --> 00:37:43,300
I was thinking,
"Well, it may be
this would indicate

736
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:44,767
"you don't know
anything about cars."

737
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,367
And I started to look into
some of the lyrics, actually.

738
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,367
If you're familiar with the
lyrics of the early songs.

739
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,633
-SMITH: Oh, jeez. Oh, jeez.
-I wasn't born.

740
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:53,133
I a song called
Gettin' Jiggy Wit It...

741
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:55,867
-Yes.
-I remember that.
Yeah, I know that.

742
00:37:58,167 --> 00:37:59,833
I don't recognise that one.

743
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:02,633
It's got "850 IS..."

744
00:38:02,667 --> 00:38:04,733
850 IS if you need a lift.

745
00:38:04,767 --> 00:38:05,900
"Who's the kid in the drop?"

746
00:38:05,933 --> 00:38:07,600
Who else? Will Smith.

747
00:38:08,267 --> 00:38:09,400
You were there?

748
00:38:09,433 --> 00:38:11,200
Now "drop", I presume,
means drop-top.

749
00:38:11,233 --> 00:38:12,233
Drop-top, yes.

750
00:38:12,267 --> 00:38:14,300
They never did
a drop-top 850.

751
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,333
The... One second.

752
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,600
It's a small...

753
00:38:20,067 --> 00:38:23,700
-(LAUGHING)
-No, it's...

754
00:38:23,733 --> 00:38:25,067
Now hold on.
See now, he...

755
00:38:25,067 --> 00:38:26,733
So he thinks
he knows everything.

756
00:38:26,767 --> 00:38:28,467
He thinks he knows everything.

757
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,600
In the United States,
we do a thing where
we customise our car.

758
00:38:31,633 --> 00:38:34,533
-Yeah.
-(LAUGHS)

759
00:38:34,567 --> 00:38:36,867
-Can I just give you
another one?
-This is brilliant.

760
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,867
Just Cruisin'. The maestro.

761
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,333
-Do you know the next bit?
-Yes, yes, yes.

762
00:38:41,367 --> 00:38:44,400
-"Nice flow..."
-Nice flow. Hot like nitro.

763
00:38:44,433 --> 00:38:45,967
-"Cool as ice, though."
-Cool as ice, though.

764
00:38:46,067 --> 00:38:47,100
That's a dichotomy.

765
00:38:47,133 --> 00:38:48,600
Do you know
what a maestro is?

766
00:38:48,633 --> 00:38:49,933
-Oh, you've got one?
-There you go.

767
00:38:49,967 --> 00:38:52,367
(LAUGHING)

768
00:38:54,267 --> 00:38:55,467
Okay.

for me to hear you say
my lyrics, Clarkson.

773
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:08,267
-CLARKSON: Not bad.
-No, it's making
my eyes water.

774
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:12,567
We've done enough of this now.
We wanna get on to your laps.

775
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,133
-Ok, yeah.
-How did you
enjoy it out there?

776
00:39:15,167 --> 00:39:17,167
It was really fun.
It was really nerve-wracking.

777
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,700
-CLARKSON: Was it?
-Yeah.

778
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:20,567
-Are you still...
-No, it's fantastic.

779
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,967
Like, I've never...

780
00:39:22,067 --> 00:39:25,067
Well, you know,
in the United States,

781
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,700
the stick is
on the other side,

782
00:39:26,733 --> 00:39:29,400
so having to drive
and do it with the other...
It was...

783
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:31,067
That's an advantage
for you, of course,

784
00:39:31,067 --> 00:39:32,400
'cause you're used
to driving at the left.

785
00:39:32,433 --> 00:39:34,067
Which is why he's obviously
mentioning it right now.

786
00:39:34,067 --> 00:39:35,400
CLARKSON: Yeah,
he's already starting...

787
00:39:35,433 --> 00:39:37,067
'Cause, like, "In case
she beats me on the laps,

788
00:39:37,067 --> 00:39:38,700
"it's the whole
switching sides."

789
00:39:38,733 --> 00:39:39,867
In case her time was better.

790
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,167
Okay. Margot you went first

791
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,367
and, well, there was
a bit of an off.

Who'd like to see Margot...

let's not let Will know that
that happened.

Come on, let's play the tape.
-Oh, good.

Oh, well, it's Chicago.

No, relax. We've got
a little present for you.

as a souvenir of your trip.

-I'm so sorry.

both your laps still
to have a look at.

so much faster.

weirdly...

Are we gonna make it
without running over Iain?

828
00:41:05,667 --> 00:41:07,433
Oh, waving to Iain.
It's a little wave there.

829
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:09,167
-That was nice.
-ROBBIE:  So sorry, Iain.

830
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,433
Don't brake. Don't brake.
Don't brake.

831
00:41:11,467 --> 00:41:13,100
SMITH:  Don't brake.
Don't brake.

832
00:41:14,367 --> 00:41:15,933
(SMITH SNICKERS)

833
00:41:15,967 --> 00:41:17,767
CLARKSON:  You do look like
you're concentrating in there.

834
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,467
SMITH:  Yeah.
CLARKSON:  Got to be.

835
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,800
ROBBIE:  Try not to
hit anyone, but...

836
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:24,500
CLARKSON:  This is good.
I'm liking a lot of this.
SMITH:  Mmm-hmm.

837
00:41:25,633 --> 00:41:26,767
CLARKSON:  Yes.

838
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,200
Whew.

839
00:41:28,233 --> 00:41:29,900
CLARKSON:  Right,
coming up to the fastest bit.

840
00:41:29,933 --> 00:41:31,800
Foot down. Foot down.
Foot down. Foot down.

841
00:41:32,633 --> 00:41:34,500
(LAUGHTER)

842
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,467
ROBBIE:  Confidence, that was.
That was the look
of confidence.

843
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,833
CLARKSON:
Great face.

844
00:41:38,867 --> 00:41:40,533
Through the tyres
Yes, take it easy.

845
00:41:40,567 --> 00:41:41,900
SMITH:  Ooh.

846
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:43,200
CLARKSON:  That does look
quick, though.

847
00:41:43,233 --> 00:41:44,933
That was the fun one.
I liked it.

848
00:41:44,967 --> 00:41:46,300
CLARKSON:
Second to last corner.

849
00:41:46,333 --> 00:41:47,567
This is what normally
catches people out.

850
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,733
SMITH:  Yeah, that's the one.

851
00:41:48,767 --> 00:41:50,367
CLARKSON:
Through there easily.

852
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,067
To Gambon,
and more understeer.

853
00:41:53,067 --> 00:41:55,267
Lot of understeer
and across the line.

854
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,467
There we are.

855
00:42:00,633 --> 00:42:01,967
And now...

856
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,233
Now, that was pretty...
That was strong.

857
00:42:05,267 --> 00:42:07,300
Yeah, it is strong,
Mr Will Smith.

858
00:42:07,333 --> 00:42:09,267
Yeah. No, but every...
It was on the left for me.

859
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,800
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-I'm used to driving...

860
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:12,067
Any more?

861
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,200
I had back surgery,
like, three days ago.

862
00:42:14,867 --> 00:42:16,067
CLARKSON: Yeah.

863
00:42:18,633 --> 00:42:22,567
Who'd like to see the lap
with the poor man with
the back surgery himself?

864
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,233
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

865
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,467
-Oh.
-Let's have a look.
Here we go.

866
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,867
-(TYRES SCREECH)
-Whoa! That was some revvs.

867
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,367
(ENGINE REVVING)

868
00:42:33,067 --> 00:42:34,400
-Yep.
-Whoo!

869
00:42:34,433 --> 00:42:36,067
(SMITH LAUGHS)

870
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,333
Ah.

871
00:42:37,367 --> 00:42:38,600
All right,
this is the one.

872
00:42:38,633 --> 00:42:39,900
CLARKSON:  Did you do
a few practices?

873
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:42,100
SMITH:  Yeah. Yeah, I did
a few practice laps.

874
00:42:42,133 --> 00:42:44,267
CLARKSON:  That's a hard bit of
braking mid corner there.

875
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,600
I'll tell you what, though.
That car would bull
a GM's finest.

876
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,367
Yeah, powering through.
Feeling good.

877
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,433
CLARKSON:  Here we go.
This is the spiritual
successor of the IROC Z.

878
00:42:56,467 --> 00:42:58,467
SMITH: (LAUGHING) Yeah.

879
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,967
I'm on the wall now.
They're putting me
on the wall.

880
00:43:01,367 --> 00:43:02,967
My name

881
00:43:03,067 --> 00:43:05,467
with all of the fastest times
on this track.

882
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,767
(SMITH LAUGHS)

883
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,533
CLARKSON: That is
a confident man right there.

884
00:43:08,567 --> 00:43:11,300
It's actually
lovely conditions
for a fast time, this.

885
00:43:11,333 --> 00:43:13,167
Keeping it
in the lines nicely.

886
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,167
Yes, just like watching Daniel
Ricciardo all over again.

887
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,467
This is the one
that makes my children proud.

888
00:43:23,433 --> 00:43:25,633
CLARKSON:  Keep it in there.
No braking. Flat out. Yeah?

889
00:43:25,667 --> 00:43:27,433
SMITH:  No braking. Flat out.
CLARKSON:  Good man.

890
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:33,433
Yeah, that's
looking very tidy.

891
00:43:33,467 --> 00:43:36,367
Second-to-last corner.
You have any problems?

892
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,733
No, that is neat.
Very neat.

893
00:43:38,767 --> 00:43:40,900
And through Gambon.

894
00:43:40,933 --> 00:43:43,367
Still on all four wheels,
unlike some people,

895
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,800
-and there we are.
Across the line.
-Whoo!

896
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:48,867
-That was nice.
-That was so much fun.

897
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,533
-Yeah.
-Well done, you two.

898
00:43:51,567 --> 00:43:55,133
Where do you think you've
come on the board?

899
00:43:55,167 --> 00:43:56,767
(GRUNTS)

900
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,400
I'll be really psyched
if I get on the board,
to be honest.

901
00:43:59,433 --> 00:44:01,800
You can't not be on the it,
because, trust me,

902
00:44:01,833 --> 00:44:03,367
Jack Whitehall,
Ed Sheeran, they're...

903
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,367
So there's space
down there for me? Okay.

904
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,633
I want 1:52.

905
00:44:06,667 --> 00:44:09,333
1:52, and Will?

906
00:44:09,367 --> 00:44:13,133
Um... Well,
I want, like, 1:22.

907
00:44:13,167 --> 00:44:15,333
(ALL LAUGHING)

908
00:44:15,367 --> 00:44:16,767
CLARKSON: Yeah.
SMITH: That's what I want.

909
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,767
-You're asking
what I think I did?
-Yeah. Yeah.

910
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,767
Oh, man.

911
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,533
I think I might be
in the 1:50 zone.

912
00:44:25,567 --> 00:44:27,100
Right in there.

913
00:44:27,133 --> 00:44:29,267
-Somewhere with
the Hugh Bonneville...
-I felt like...

914
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:31,500
CLARKSON: These are wet times.
Well, let's have
a look, shall we?

915
00:44:31,533 --> 00:44:34,867
-Let's have a look.
I've got the times here.
-Yeah. Oh, jeez. Okay.

916
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:37,100
-I'm going to did
you first, Will.
-Okay.

917
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:38,800
-Oh, jeez.
-This is really exciting.

918
00:44:38,833 --> 00:44:40,933
-Will Smith...
-This is very exciting.

919
00:44:40,967 --> 00:44:42,733
You did a one...

920
00:44:42,767 --> 00:44:44,300
That's a good start.

921
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:45,600
(ALL LAUGHING)

922
00:44:45,633 --> 00:44:47,133
-...40...
-Whoo!

923
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:51,067
-...seven...
-Whoa!

924
00:44:51,067 --> 00:44:53,400
-...two.
-OK. Yeah. I'm not
mad at that.

925
00:44:53,433 --> 00:44:55,600
That is not a very
bad time at all.

926
00:44:55,633 --> 00:44:58,067
-That puts you...
-Wow.

927
00:44:58,067 --> 00:45:00,533
-OK, yeah.
-ROBBIE: That's really great.

928
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:03,733
I'm not mad at that.
I'm not mad at that.

929
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:04,833
-That's not bad.
-I like that.

930
00:45:04,867 --> 00:45:06,867
-That is not bad at all.
-Yeah.

931
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:10,200
-And, now, we must
get onto your co-star.
-Okay.

932
00:45:10,233 --> 00:45:11,567
Oh, God.

933
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,300
If you beat me, this is
your last day on the tour.

934

(ALL LAUGHING)

935
00:45:16,267 --> 00:45:18,167
I will never work
again after this.

936
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,700
It's Leo, Will Smith,
and then TV.

937

-Oh, good!

-...40...
-Ooh!

This was a bad idea.
This was a really bad idea.

953

It's like the Academy Awards
where you've got to clap
for the other person.

(ALL LAUGHING)

00:46:24,233 --> 00:46:26,600
-I don't know what to say now.
-I actually can't
believe that.

done amazing times.
-ROBBIE: Oh, my God.

-Yeah.
-There was a tenth in it.

00:46:30,733 --> 00:46:32,933
Neither of you have got
anything to be ashamed about

959

-and it has...
-Oh, no! One of us has
something to be ashamed about!

-I was trying to end on
a really high note...
-No, no.

-...coming up with
some nice things...
-Yeah.

962

...but you're right.

963
00:46:45,433 --> 00:46:47,300
Ladies and gentlemen,
I think you'll all agree,

964
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:50,500
this has been an absolute joy.
Will Smith and Margot Robbie.

965
00:46:50,533 --> 00:46:52,533
(CHEERING)

966
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:05,300
Right, now we must move on
to some very sad news.

967
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:09,267
The Land Rover Defender
is going out of production

968
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:14,067
and our producers thought that
that meant it deserved
a fitting obituary

969
00:47:14,067 --> 00:47:18,267
and all we needed for that was
a beach and a rural simpleton.

970
00:47:23,167 --> 00:47:25,333
HAMMOND:
It's a little-known fact

971
00:47:25,367 --> 00:47:29,367
that several of mankind's
greatest inventions

972
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:34,767
have started out
as drawings in the sand
on a beach.

973
00:47:35,767 --> 00:47:38,067
Henry Royce,
of Rolls-Royce fame,

974
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,300
made his first sketch
of the Merlin engine,

975
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:44,167
the incredible motor that
powered the Spitfire
and the Lancaster,

976
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,567
in the sand
at his local beach.

977
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,933
Norman Woodland,
no, I'd never heard
of him either,

978
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:53,267
was in Miami when he
revolutionised shopping

979
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:56,833
by drawing the first bar code
in the sand.

980
00:47:59,067 --> 00:48:02,733
And in 1947, here at
Red Wharf Bay in Anglesey,

981
00:48:02,767 --> 00:48:05,133
it was the same story
for the Land Rover.

982
00:48:07,367 --> 00:48:11,267
The sketch was done by
a chap called Maurice Wilks,

983
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:14,800
who was the technical director
for Rover cars.

984
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:20,400
At the time, he used
an old Bren Gun Carrier
to get around on his farm,

985
00:48:20,433 --> 00:48:25,367
until one day he swapped it
for his neighbour's
old Willys jeep,

986
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:30,500
and soon thought,
"Hang on, we can make
something like this."

987
00:48:32,067 --> 00:48:35,067
So, he sketched out
his creation in the sand,

988
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,767
and a first prototype
was quickly built

989
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,733
over the following few months.

990
00:48:40,767 --> 00:48:43,600
Sadly, though,
there was a bit of an issue.

991
00:48:45,467 --> 00:48:48,800
You see, Maurice thought
putting the steering wheel
in the middle

992
00:48:48,833 --> 00:48:52,800
would mean they could sell it
to right and left hand
drive countries

993
00:48:52,833 --> 00:48:56,067
without having
to re-engineer it.

994
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,400
But then they realised that,
amongst other things,

995
00:48:58,433 --> 00:49:02,067
that was gonna make
hand signals rather tricky.

996
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:04,233
So it was back
to the drawing board.

997
00:49:06,167 --> 00:49:10,567
And a mere 10 months
after that shaky start

998
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,333
the first Land Rover was born.

999
00:49:18,467 --> 00:49:20,600
It came in this green

1000
00:49:20,633 --> 00:49:24,067
because the only paint
that Land Rover could
lay their hands on

1001
00:49:24,067 --> 00:49:28,100
was surplus army leftovers
they'd used for Spitfires.

1002
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:30,067
The body was aluminium,

1003
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,167
not for clever
engineering reasons

1004
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,933
but because steel
was in short supply.

1005
00:49:35,967 --> 00:49:39,233
If ever there was an underdog,
it was this.

1006
00:49:40,367 --> 00:49:43,233
Nobody back then
could have predicted

1007
00:49:43,267 --> 00:49:47,133
what a phenomenon
the underdog would
turn out to be.

1008
00:49:48,733 --> 00:49:51,267
The military bought it
by the thousand,

1009
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:56,100
and it was used by everyone
from the Medical Corp
to the SAS.

1010
00:49:56,133 --> 00:50:00,767
While in civilian life,
it was the very definition
of versatile.

1011
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,700
You could have
a Land Rover tank,
a Land Rover train,

1012
00:50:04,733 --> 00:50:08,967
a Land Rover conveyor belt,
a snow plough, a fire engine,

1013
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,933
and, rather annoyingly,

1014
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,500
a Land Rover hovervan.

1015
00:50:16,667 --> 00:50:19,367
If explorers
wanted to explore,

1016
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:23,333
adventurers wanted
to conquer terrain that
was unconquerable,

1017
00:50:24,533 --> 00:50:26,000
they'd turn to one of these.

1018
00:50:28,533 --> 00:50:30,667
It was the first
production vehicle

1019
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:35,033
to travel 18,000 miles
from England to Singapore,

1020
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:39,133
the first to cross
the Bering Strait,

1021
00:50:40,367 --> 00:50:42,967
and the machine of choice
for Ranulph Fiennes

1022
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,200
on his epic
trans-global expedition.

1023
00:50:46,233 --> 00:50:50,100
In fact, at one time
the first car ever seen

1024
00:50:50,133 --> 00:50:54,633
by 60% of the developing world
was a Land Rover.

1025
00:50:54,667 --> 00:51:01,100
And on top of that,
it's been in production
for 67 years.

1026
00:51:01,133 --> 00:51:02,933
Sixty seven years!

1027
00:51:03,467 --> 00:51:04,533
The production run alone

1028
00:51:04,567 --> 00:51:07,067
makes this thing
one of the greats.

1029
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:11,433
Look at the other icons.
The Beetle, I'd say 57 years.

1030
00:51:11,467 --> 00:51:16,300
2CV, well, that was a real
fly-by-night, 42 years.

1031
00:51:16,333 --> 00:51:19,533
So great is my love
for this machine

1032
00:51:19,567 --> 00:51:23,633
that when, 13 years ago,
we ran
a Top Gear  competition

1033
00:51:23,667 --> 00:51:27,633
asking viewers to vote for
the greatest car of all time,

1034
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:30,067
I championed the Land Rover.

1035
00:51:30,067 --> 00:51:33,567
And the public clearly agreed,
because it won.

1036
00:51:35,233 --> 00:51:38,233
I drove a Series 1
in that film.

1037
00:51:38,267 --> 00:51:40,933
It was old
and tatty and worn.

1038
00:51:40,967 --> 00:51:43,633
But I fell so completely
in love with it

1039
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:47,367
that I actually bought it
so I could restore it.

1040
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,400
I'll never forget the day
I brought it home,
13 years ago.

1041
00:51:50,433 --> 00:51:53,767
It stood in this very yard
like a lost orphan.

1042
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:56,067
So, I took it
into the workshop,
stripped it down

1043
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:57,400
and laid it
all out on the floor

1044
00:51:57,433 --> 00:52:01,200
so I could begin
that long, loving process

1045
00:52:01,233 --> 00:52:04,400
of restoring it
to its former glory.

1046
00:52:04,433 --> 00:52:05,800
And here it is.

1047
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:19,133
Yeah, I mean,
I have been really busy.

1048
00:52:19,167 --> 00:52:23,367
And the thing is,
it's good to have
a lot of spare parts

1049
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:28,167
because Land Rovers
break down a lot,
so you never know.

1050
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:31,167
Can't be too sentimental
about these things.

1051
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:37,067
But because it is
the greatest car ever made,
I must now try to make amends

1052
00:52:37,067 --> 00:52:39,200
by giving it
a fitting send-off.

1053
00:52:41,733 --> 00:52:44,867
And this is the
perfect starting point.

1054
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,867
There are many great
Land Rover TV adverts,

1055
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,333
but what you're watching now

1056
00:52:49,367 --> 00:52:51,633
is the most famous
of them all.

1057
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:57,367
This is the one
where it winches itself
up a vast, steep dam.

1058
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,167
MAN: (ON TV)  Next time
you're late for work,

1059
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:03,333
it's worth remembering
that nothing, but nothing,

1060
00:53:03,367 --> 00:53:05,233
gets in the way
of a Land Rover.

1061
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,733
Now, the thing is,

1062
00:53:11,767 --> 00:53:14,800
that advert,
as exciting as it looked,

1063
00:53:14,833 --> 00:53:17,067
was, I'm afraid,
the result of,

1064
00:53:17,067 --> 00:53:20,433
shall we say,
the magic of television.

1065
00:53:20,467 --> 00:53:24,433
Because the Land Rover
didn't winch itself up.

1066
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:28,533
The winch on the front bumper
pulled it the first few feet
out of the water,

1067
00:53:28,567 --> 00:53:31,833
but then it was
actually hauled
the rest of the way up

1068
00:53:31,867 --> 00:53:36,367
by a much bigger winch
hidden at the top of the dam.

1069
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,067
So I think you can
probably see
what's coming next.

1070
00:53:40,067 --> 00:53:43,067
As our tribute to the
Land Rover Defender

1071
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:46,200
we are going to
redo that stunt properly.

1072
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,600
Oh, God.

1073
00:53:55,433 --> 00:53:59,233
The dam I'll be climbing
is Claerwen in Wales.

1074
00:54:00,667 --> 00:54:02,667
It's 1,200 feet wide,

1075
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:07,800
and, more worryingly for me,
200 feet high.

1076
00:54:07,833 --> 00:54:15,067
To make things worse,
the Land Rover I'll be using
is 64 years old.

1077
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:19,400
So, in order to do what
they never managed
in the TV advert,

1078
00:54:19,433 --> 00:54:23,067
we've added some bits.

1079
00:54:23,067 --> 00:54:27,467
When they made that advert,
there wasn't a winch around
big enough to take on board

1080
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:30,933
all the cable you need
to go up a big dam.

1081
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:33,667
So, we...
Well, not Jeremy and me,

1082
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:36,567
somebody else has built
this ginormous one.

1083
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:40,500
Then, there's the matter
of the engine.

1084
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:45,433
You see, when this thing
starts to go up the dam

1085
00:54:45,467 --> 00:54:47,067
it will go vertical.

1086
00:54:47,067 --> 00:54:51,067
And at that point
the engine at the front
will cut out.

1087
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:54,333
Problem, because we need
the engine to power the winch.

1088
00:54:54,367 --> 00:54:58,600
Solution, a second engine
just for the winch.

1089
00:54:58,633 --> 00:55:01,633
Best of all, this is built
so that it can pivot.

1090
00:55:01,667 --> 00:55:05,800
As the Land Rover
goes vertical,
this stays level.

1091
00:55:05,833 --> 00:55:09,067
None of this gave me
much comfort, however,

1092
00:55:09,067 --> 00:55:11,367
when I was standing
at the bottom.

1093
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:15,333
Oh, bloody hell.

1094
00:55:15,367 --> 00:55:20,967
It's much steeper
than the other dam
in the advert.

1095
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:24,133
For a brief moment
I thought I was off the hook,

1096
00:55:24,167 --> 00:55:27,967
because the start point
looked completely
inaccessible.

1097
00:55:28,067 --> 00:55:31,200
Sadly, the producers
had thought of that.

1098
00:55:32,067 --> 00:55:34,200
I hate problem-solvers.

1099
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,233
And this just a little
amuse-bouche.

1100
00:55:40,467 --> 00:55:43,200
Eventually, I was in place.

1101
00:55:43,233 --> 00:55:46,133
The winch cable
was attached to the top.

1102
00:55:49,767 --> 00:55:52,067
And it was time to begin.

1103
00:55:52,067 --> 00:55:53,733
(CABLE STRAINING)

1104
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:57,267
That's the engine in the back
that powers the winch,
remember,

1105
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:58,933
because of the angle.

1106
00:55:58,967 --> 00:56:02,133
Um, I'd love to think of
something else to say or do.

1107
00:56:02,167 --> 00:56:04,267
I can't. So I'm gonna go.
So, um...

1108
00:56:05,133 --> 00:56:06,600
Right. Here I go.

1109

(WINCH WHIRRING)

1110
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:12,967
Oh, it's tensioning up.

1111
00:56:16,667 --> 00:56:18,067
This is okay so far.

1112
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,833
Oh, there it is.

1113
00:56:26,867 --> 00:56:29,067
Oh, my God!

Oh!

1116
00:56:38,567 --> 00:56:40,567
I know it's slow.

1117
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:45,467
Any faster, and I risk
burning out all the
winch motors and things.

1118
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:50,767
Plus, there was an issue with
the face of the dam itself.

1119
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,733
The one on the advert
was smooth concrete,
this is rough stone.

1120
00:56:54,767 --> 00:56:56,833
I didn't take
that into account.

1121
00:56:59,433 --> 00:57:02,067
What I'm gonna do is steer
between these rocks

1122
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:04,067
where they stick out
from the face.

1123
00:57:05,067 --> 00:57:07,500

-I'm having to
read the surface.
-(THUDDING)

1125
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:10,900
Ooh!

1126
00:57:12,533 --> 00:57:16,467
This vertical off-roading
gave me another problem.

1127
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:21,400
Because the Land Rover
is winching itself up

1128
00:57:21,433 --> 00:57:23,300
on its own winch,

1129
00:57:23,333 --> 00:57:25,567
the cable has to feed
evenly onto the drum.

1130
00:57:26,867 --> 00:57:29,267
If it doesn't do that,
everything gets ruined.

1131
00:57:30,767 --> 00:57:32,467
I couldn't see the drum,

1132
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:35,933
so up top, the producers
were spotting for me.

1133
00:57:36,733 --> 00:57:38,300
Straighten it up
please, Richard.

1134
00:57:42,533 --> 00:57:44,067
Ah.

1135
00:57:44,467 --> 00:57:45,433
Oh.

1136
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:49,433
Ugh.

1137
00:57:52,067 --> 00:57:54,300
You know, because it's so slow
I've got time to think about

1138
00:57:54,333 --> 00:57:56,333
what would happen if...
Don't. I can't. I daren't.

1139
00:57:56,367 --> 00:57:57,733
I am now terrified.

1140
00:57:57,767 --> 00:58:00,067
I am now absolutely petrified.

1141
00:58:01,167 --> 00:58:02,200
Oh.

1142
00:58:05,067 --> 00:58:08,800
Past the halfway point,
it started to get even worse.

1143
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:13,233
I can feel the
front wheels now
going very light,

1144
00:58:13,267 --> 00:58:17,567
because where it goes concave,
where it bellies in like that,

1145
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,633
my winch cable is pulling
the front of the car
off the ground.

1146
00:58:20,667 --> 00:58:21,833
Oh!

1147
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,367
And I can't tell you
how horrible that feels.

1152
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:38,433
(CABLE CREAKING)

1153
00:58:38,467 --> 00:58:40,067
Honestly, mate,
you've got about 20 seconds.

1154
00:58:40,067 --> 00:58:41,867
I'm fucking scared, okay?
And I mean it.

1155
00:58:44,267 --> 00:58:46,067
Okay, take your mind off it.
Take your mind off it.

1156
00:58:46,067 --> 00:58:47,733
-Um, this...
-(THUDDING)

1157
00:58:47,767 --> 00:58:49,733
(YELPING)

1158
00:58:49,767 --> 00:58:55,867
The water behind this dam
can supply Birmingham with
79 million gallons a day.

1159
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:57,600
Who gives a fuck right now?

1160
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,900
It's all right, we're good.

1161
00:59:05,433 --> 00:59:06,867
HAMMOND:
It's really vertical now.

1162
00:59:11,533 --> 00:59:12,867
Oh, God.

1163
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:15,467
(CABLE STRAINING)

1164
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:16,933
I can hear the lines...

1165
00:59:16,967 --> 00:59:19,167
I can actually hear
the tension in that wire.

1166
00:59:23,133 --> 00:59:26,467
As I get to the top,
the cable becomes less strong.

1167
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:29,067
Partly because,
as well as the weight of
the Land Rover and me,

1168
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,833
it has to be carrying
the weight of itself
and the winch.

1169
00:59:35,633 --> 00:59:37,067
(CABLE STRAINING)

1170
00:59:38,633 --> 00:59:40,733
Oh, God, I'm depending so much

1171
00:59:40,767 --> 00:59:42,867
on things made
by other people.

1172
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,900
Every single part now,

1173
00:59:44,933 --> 00:59:46,900
the brake that stops
the winch feeding out,

1174
00:59:46,933 --> 00:59:48,900
the engine, everything.

1175
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:53,533
In the face of
unutterable terror,

1176
00:59:53,567 --> 00:59:56,400
I was finally nearing the top.

1177
00:59:59,267 --> 01:00:01,467
We have nearly done this.
I've nearly cracked it.

1178
01:00:02,633 --> 01:00:04,800
Two hundred feet
of near-vertical rock.

1179
01:00:08,467 --> 01:00:09,533
(CABLE STRAINING)

1180
01:00:10,333 --> 01:00:11,233
Just a few more inches,

1181
01:00:11,267 --> 01:00:13,367
another few turns
on the winch.

1182
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:23,400
What a fantastic way
to pay tribute to the car...

1183
01:00:23,433 --> 01:00:25,167
What?

1184
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:29,200
It was at this point
the producers broke
the bad news.

1185
01:00:29,233 --> 01:00:32,300
Because of where
the winch cable was attached,

1186
01:00:32,333 --> 01:00:35,100
the Land Rover
wouldn't be able to climb over

1187
01:00:35,133 --> 01:00:37,400
onto the flat dam top.

1188
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:40,033
And this meant only one thing.

1189
01:00:42,167 --> 01:00:44,000
I'm gonna have
to go back down.

1190
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,900
I'm gonna have to winch it
down the dam.

1191
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:53,900
I really need to piss.

1192
01:00:56,567 --> 01:00:58,733
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

1193
01:00:58,767 --> 01:01:02,833
Thank you. Thank you.
It was nothing.

1194
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:04,933
Really, it was nothing.

1195
01:01:07,733 --> 01:01:10,200
So, you failed.

1196
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:12,200
Well, I almost
got to the top.

1197
01:01:12,233 --> 01:01:14,333
Yeah, but then you just came
straight back down again.

1198
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:17,067
I'm sorry, Hammond,
if I said, "I'm going
to drive to Bristol",

1199
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:19,733
got nearly to Bristol
and came home again,

1200
01:01:19,767 --> 01:01:21,633
that's not going to Bristol.

1201
01:01:21,667 --> 01:01:25,733
Look, the main thing is I gave
the Land Rover Defender
a fitting send-off.

1202
01:01:25,767 --> 01:01:28,333
Yeah, but, Hammond,
they're working on
a new Defender now

1203
01:01:28,367 --> 01:01:31,633
and it looks exactly
the same as the old one.

1204
01:01:31,667 --> 01:01:35,567
So you said you'd drive
to the top of a dam,
which you didn't,

1205
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:40,067
to pay tribute to a car
that you said was about
to die, but it's not.

1206
01:01:40,067 --> 01:01:41,833
Yeah.

1207
01:01:41,867 --> 01:01:45,100
Well, that means you're a liar
and you've completely
wasted our time.

1208
01:01:45,133 --> 01:01:46,467
Yeah.

1209
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,800
And on that bombshell,
I'm afraid it's time to end.

1210
01:01:48,833 --> 01:01:51,367
Next week,
normal service is resumed.

1211
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,967
James and I have a lot
of crashes on purpose.

1212
01:01:54,067 --> 01:01:55,300
Hopefully we
shall see you then.

1213
01:01:55,333 --> 01:01:56,933
Thank you for watching,
good night!

1214
01:01:56,967 --> 01:01:59,267
