1
00:00:29,001 --> 00:00:30,026
Please!

2
00:00:30,026 --> 00:00:33,055
Please listen to me!
It's my fault!

3
00:00:33,055 --> 00:00:35,077
I'm sorry! I'm really sorry!

4
00:00:36,014 --> 00:00:37,056
Kiss me.

5
00:00:37,093 --> 00:00:40,052
Come on, kiss me.

6
00:00:41,056 --> 00:00:45,019
I won't interfere in this again,
and I won't be a Curse User anymore!

7
00:00:45,019 --> 00:00:47,007
Kiss me, please?

8
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:48,009
Come on, kiss me.

9
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:51,024
Of course, I'll quit Q too!

10
00:00:51,024 --> 00:00:54,012
Right, I'll go home and be a farmer.

11
00:00:56,012 --> 00:00:57,054
Did you hear me?!

12
00:00:58,037 --> 00:01:01,021
I don't think curse users
know much about farming.

13
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:02,075
So you heard me.

14
00:01:02,075 --> 00:01:05,005
How dare a student look down on me?

15
00:01:05,005 --> 00:01:07,067
Mr. Bayer has already arrived anyway.

16
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,022
He is the strongest combatant of Q.

17
00:01:11,022 --> 00:01:13,008
- All of you will—
- Let me ask you.

18
00:01:14,051 --> 00:01:16,031
Is he the Bayer you are talking about?

19
00:01:21,006 --> 00:01:23,031
Right, it's him.

20
00:01:24,098 --> 00:01:27,082
Q'S STRONGEST COMBATANT BAYER LEFT
AND CAUSED DISINTEGRATION OF THE ORGANIZATION

21
00:01:33,032 --> 00:01:35,078
Look, all boats are lining up in a row.

22
00:01:35,078 --> 00:01:39,004
Starting from the inner circle,
one, two, three, four, five, six.

23
00:01:39,004 --> 00:01:42,083
It starts now, with all boats rowing
in a beautiful straight line.

24
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:45,001
I was wondering where you ran off to.

25
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:46,029
What are you doing here?

26
00:01:49,017 --> 00:01:51,076
I'm making money with money.

27
00:01:51,076 --> 00:01:55,009
I have never seen you win though.

28
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:57,006
Don't you have work?

29
00:01:57,006 --> 00:01:59,018
You're really annoying.

30
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:01,092
You make me sound like an idler.

31
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,002
You're an idler.

32
00:02:05,044 --> 00:02:07,007
As an agent,

33
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:10,004
I have an obligation to report
your work performance to the client.

34
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,095
That guy is the eldest son
of the Gojo family.

35
00:02:12,095 --> 00:02:16,002
I couldn't do anything to him
if I ran over there without a plan.

36
00:02:16,074 --> 00:02:19,066
We need to send a few idiots
to weaken him first.

37
00:02:20,008 --> 00:02:21,083
You are the one who's got work to do.

38
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:23,071
I am working, idiot.

39
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:25,038
What were you thinking?

40
00:02:25,038 --> 00:02:27,054
You actually paid the full deposit.

41
00:02:28,034 --> 00:02:30,046
I said I wanted to weaken him.

42
00:02:30,046 --> 00:02:33,017
You don't have to worry.
I'll make all the money back.

43
00:02:33,017 --> 00:02:35,005
Just like in this race.

44
00:02:36,084 --> 00:02:39,001
Boat No. 6 Hatano
reaches the finish line.

45
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:41,031
The boat No. 1 Douguchi
is the second to do so.

46
00:02:41,031 --> 00:02:45,035
And the third is boat No. 2 Matsuda.

47
00:02:45,035 --> 00:02:48,073
It seems you're not good
at making easy money.

48
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:52,074
I'll leave it to you, Sorcerer Killer.

49
00:02:54,011 --> 00:02:55,024
By the way,

50
00:02:55,095 --> 00:02:57,035
is Megumi doing well?

51
00:03:09,003 --> 00:03:10,053
Who are you talking about?

52
00:03:10,096 --> 00:03:13,097
EPISODE 26: HIDDEN INVENTORY PART 2

53
00:03:22,089 --> 00:03:28,023
JUJUTSU KAISEN SEASON 2

54
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:46,093
Should we bring her to a doctor?

55
00:04:47,027 --> 00:04:51,004
If only we could use
Reverse Cursed Technique like Shoko.

56
00:04:51,004 --> 00:04:53,002
No, we can't do that.

57
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:55,065
After all, we can't even
understand what she is saying.

58
00:04:55,065 --> 00:04:58,028
Just like this and that.

59
00:04:58,028 --> 00:05:00,095
This and that.
You don't understand?

60
00:05:01,032 --> 00:05:02,095
You guys really have no talent.

61
00:05:07,087 --> 00:05:08,096
She woke up.

62
00:05:13,071 --> 00:05:15,069
Watch this!

63
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:19,009
You despicable villain!

64
00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:22,003
You dare to hurt me.
I'll kill you first!

65
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:26,085
Riko, calm down.

66
00:05:26,085 --> 00:05:30,023
We are not with those
people who attacked you.

67
00:05:30,052 --> 00:05:32,009
Quit it! You clearly look like a liar.

68
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:34,061
Your bangs are weird too.

69
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:39,065
Stop!

70
00:05:41,002 --> 00:05:42,061
CRACKLING

71
00:05:42,061 --> 00:05:44,024
This is disrespectful!

72
00:05:44,024 --> 00:05:45,099
Please... please stop!

73
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:47,037
Kuroi.

74
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:52,029
Miss, these two gentlemen
are our companions.

75
00:05:53,033 --> 00:05:56,038
Kuroi, what is this thing you are riding?

76
00:05:56,075 --> 00:05:59,067
This is the Cursed Technique
of the gentleman with bangs.

77
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,076
Can you please not call me that?

78
00:06:02,093 --> 00:06:04,048
Cursed Spirits Manipulation.

79
00:06:04,048 --> 00:06:05,069
Just as the name implies,

80
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:08,001
I can control
the cursed spirits I've absorbed.

81
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:11,027
This kid is more aggressive than I thought.

82
00:06:11,058 --> 00:06:13,089
I thought the merging
would make you sentimental.

83
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:16,036
I was even wondering
how to take care of your feelings.

84
00:06:17,086 --> 00:06:20,065
What a way of thinking
for a despicable man.

85
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:22,011
Listen carefully.

86
00:06:24,053 --> 00:06:26,037
Master Tengen is me.

87
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:28,083
I am Master Tengen.

88
00:06:29,012 --> 00:06:32,066
Some fools confuse merging
with death like you.

89
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:35,029
And it's a huge mistake.

90
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:38,067
Merging will make me become Master Tengen,

91
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:41,017
but Master Tengen will also become me.

92
00:06:41,055 --> 00:06:45,089
My consciousness, mind, and soul
will continue to live on after merging.

93
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:47,025
Did you change your wallpaper?

94
00:06:47,025 --> 00:06:48,051
It's Waka Inoue.

95
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:49,051
Listen to me!

96
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:53,001
Judging by the way she talks,
she probably has no friends.

97
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:55,065
Then we can send her off
without any worries.

98
00:06:55,065 --> 00:06:57,004
I speak normally at school!

99
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,036
School... Kuroi, what time is it now?

100
00:07:02,036 --> 00:07:05,057
It's not noon yet,
but you better not go to school.

101
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:08,016
Shut up, I'm going!

102
00:07:10,053 --> 00:07:11,054
What?

103
00:07:12,062 --> 00:07:15,005
It would be safer to have her
return to high school sooner.

104
00:07:16,008 --> 00:07:18,033
I personally wish to do so,

105
00:07:18,033 --> 00:07:20,014
but it's Master Tengen's order.

106
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:24,072
He wants us to fulfill
all of Riko Amanai's requests.

107
00:07:30,055 --> 00:07:32,097
Isn't that spoiling her too much?

108
00:07:32,097 --> 00:07:34,089
Don't say that, Satoru.

109
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:36,014
Although she said so,

110
00:07:36,014 --> 00:07:38,034
she will become
the foundation of the barrier

111
00:07:38,034 --> 00:07:40,098
at the bottom of the school
as Master Tengen after merging.

112
00:07:41,057 --> 00:07:46,074
She will never see her
friends and family again.

113
00:07:47,007 --> 00:07:49,032
Riko.

114
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,012
We need to go
for the next class.

115
00:07:53,008 --> 00:07:54,079
Just let her do what she wants.

116
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:57,079
That's our mission.

117
00:08:00,071 --> 00:08:03,038
Miss Riko has no family.

118
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:05,038
She lost her family in an accident...

119
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:08,093
I've been taking care of her since then.

120
00:08:08,093 --> 00:08:12,014
So I hope that at least you'll let her
spend more time with her friends.

121
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,081
In that case, you are her family.

122
00:08:18,044 --> 00:08:19,031
Yes.

123
00:08:22,052 --> 00:08:25,074
Suguru, how are the cursed spirits
you sent to monitor her?

124
00:08:27,011 --> 00:08:30,078
Unfortunately, I can't share
their vision like Miss Mei.

125
00:08:30,078 --> 00:08:33,045
But if anything goes wrong,
I can immediately...

126
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,008
Satoru,

127
00:08:36,008 --> 00:08:37,069
we need to hurry to Riko's school.

128
00:08:40,046 --> 00:08:42,033
Two cursed spirits have been exorcised.

129
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:45,021
Who will be the best
of the new generation?

130
00:08:45,021 --> 00:08:47,094
It will be decided in this important race.

131
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:51,034
The six boats finally
reached their destination.

132
00:08:51,034 --> 00:08:55,018
The much-anticipated fifth round
is about to begin.

133
00:09:00,035 --> 00:09:01,085
RIKO AMANAI, INTEGRITY GIRLS SCHOOL
REGARDLESS OF LIFE AND DEATH

134
00:09:14,062 --> 00:09:16,095
JUJUTSU KAISEN SEASON 2

135
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:19,016
Where's Amanai?

136
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,012
It's music class now.

137
00:09:21,012 --> 00:09:23,013
She should be in the music
room or the chapel.

138
00:09:23,013 --> 00:09:24,079
Chapel?

139
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:27,003
They have the music class
wherever the teacher wants.

140
00:09:27,003 --> 00:09:29,005
And it's a church school here.

141
00:09:29,047 --> 00:09:31,005
Satoru, you go to the chapel.

142
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:32,068
Miss Kuroi goes to the music room.

143
00:09:32,068 --> 00:09:34,006
I'll deal with the two unknowns.

144
00:09:34,006 --> 00:09:36,001
Understood.

145
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:37,093
Don't follow me!

146
00:09:37,093 --> 00:09:40,052
What if my friends see you?!

147
00:09:40,052 --> 00:09:42,027
I'm terribly sorry.

148
00:09:42,027 --> 00:09:44,098
I asked her to send me a message
before moving, but...

149
00:09:44,098 --> 00:09:49,061
That's why we told her to let us protect her
within our sight, that little brat.

150
00:09:52,003 --> 00:09:53,024
The race has started.

151
00:09:53,024 --> 00:09:55,078
Players in lanes one and two
are on the inside.

152
00:09:55,078 --> 00:10:00,041
- Player in lane three is a bit behind.
- What? They didn't return to high school?

153
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,079
Lucky.

154
00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:07,009
Now the people who got lured by the bounty
will become acceptable fools.

155
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:08,003
Is that okay?

156
00:10:08,003 --> 00:10:09,051
What's the matter?

157
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:14,084
The bounty was paid with the deposit of
30 million yen from Star Religious Group.

158
00:10:14,084 --> 00:10:17,073
If Star Plasma Vessel is killed,
your deposit will be gone.

159
00:10:17,073 --> 00:10:20,069
If there is a slight mistake,
you might not even get the reward.

160
00:10:20,069 --> 00:10:22,035
They might even think

161
00:10:22,035 --> 00:10:25,094
they should have put out the bounty
directly rather than commissioning you.

162
00:10:25,094 --> 00:10:28,082
Don't forget that Satoru Gojo is there.

163
00:10:29,015 --> 00:10:31,015
For the first time in a hundred years,

164
00:10:31,015 --> 00:10:33,045
The Six Eyes paired
with limitless cursed technique.

165
00:10:33,045 --> 00:10:35,024
As long as he's there,

166
00:10:35,024 --> 00:10:37,058
no one can kill Star Plasma Vessel.

167
00:10:37,058 --> 00:10:39,049
Including you?

168
00:10:47,088 --> 00:10:49,088
Boat No. 3 Kono takes the lead!

169
00:10:49,088 --> 00:10:52,005
Leaping ahead of everyone else.

170
00:10:52,005 --> 00:10:54,034
It's hard to say.

171
00:10:54,034 --> 00:10:56,021
He succeeded on the second try.

172
00:10:56,021 --> 00:11:01,001
Anyway, within the 47 hours
before the bounty deadline,

173
00:11:01,001 --> 00:11:05,085
let those fools wear down
Satoru and Jujutsu Sorcerers around him.

174
00:11:13,094 --> 00:11:17,011
Stop there.

175
00:11:23,008 --> 00:11:24,054
No, it's nothing.

176
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:31,092
Of course they can't kill her,
that's why they are working in vain.

177
00:11:32,003 --> 00:11:35,022
Luckily we set a time limit.

178
00:11:35,022 --> 00:11:38,001
Recruiting curse users
didn't take much effort.

179
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:39,094
But it's not just that.

180
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:43,001
It's about my perspective.

181
00:11:43,001 --> 00:11:45,006
Oh my goodness!

182
00:11:45,006 --> 00:11:48,073
Boat No. 3 Kono loses balance!
Boat No. 2 Yamazaki takes the lead!

183
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:50,009
I'll be there soon.

184
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:53,009
Things are progressing
faster than I thought.

185
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:56,061
I want the 30 million yen back in full.

186
00:11:56,061 --> 00:11:58,082
Boat No. 2 Yamazaki reaches
the finish line first.

187
00:11:59,037 --> 00:12:00,066
What's that nonsense?

188
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:02,098
It's not just a common
anonymous message board.

189
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:05,075
- Publication fee, handling fee and—
- I'm losing the signal.

190
00:12:08,067 --> 00:12:10,071
That bastard.

191
00:12:20,022 --> 00:12:22,039
The unknown person from Q?

192
00:12:22,081 --> 00:12:26,031
Things could get a bit troublesome
if it's someone from the Star Religious Group.

193
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:31,056
That uniform is...

194
00:12:36,053 --> 00:12:40,011
He assumed it's a multiple-on-one case
when he saw the high school uniform,

195
00:12:40,011 --> 00:12:42,078
and placed Shikigami in front and behind.

196
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:44,029
It seems like he's experienced.

197
00:12:45,087 --> 00:12:49,083
There is no medium, and his Cursed Energy
is different from the Jujutsu Sorcerer's.

198
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,008
Could this be...

199
00:12:51,008 --> 00:12:52,084
Cursed Spirit Manipulation?

200
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:54,055
You got it right.

201
00:12:54,055 --> 00:12:57,021
So you haven't lived so long for nothing.

202
00:12:57,021 --> 00:13:00,051
No, there's no need to live too long.

203
00:13:00,051 --> 00:13:03,068
The longer you live, the more you spend.

204
00:13:04,018 --> 00:13:06,043
His Cursed Techniques are above mine.

205
00:13:06,043 --> 00:13:09,094
But a Jujutsu Sorcerer thinks
the same as a Shikigami user.

206
00:13:09,094 --> 00:13:12,015
Besides, he's so young.

207
00:13:12,015 --> 00:13:16,011
I can see right through his thoughts.

208
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:17,048
I was right.

209
00:13:17,048 --> 00:13:20,002
He usually doesn't rush to the front.

210
00:13:20,061 --> 00:13:23,024
He must be not that good at close combat.

211
00:13:23,024 --> 00:13:28,079
And he assumes that a Shikigami user
like me won't get close to him.

212
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,037
He hates close combat
and is not vigilant about it.

213
00:13:32,037 --> 00:13:35,009
Killing him is a piece of cake.

214
00:13:35,059 --> 00:13:38,055
You seem to have thought a lot.

215
00:13:38,088 --> 00:13:40,038
But none of those matters.

216
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:48,072
What? Did he release those two
at the beginning to throw me off this attack?

217
00:13:53,081 --> 00:13:56,023
Alright, one more to go.

218
00:14:00,045 --> 00:14:02,007
You're dead!

219
00:14:18,021 --> 00:14:21,059
Tasuke, is it you?

220
00:14:22,038 --> 00:14:26,008
My parents only wanted to invest money
and time in my talented younger brother.

221
00:14:26,008 --> 00:14:30,047
They despised me for being able
to see things that others couldn't.

222
00:14:31,014 --> 00:14:36,026
Tasuke was the only one who accepted me.

223
00:14:38,057 --> 00:14:40,044
Long time no see.

224
00:14:40,044 --> 00:14:43,053
We haven't seen each other
for over 50 years.

225
00:14:43,053 --> 00:14:46,037
Tasuke, ever since you die—

226
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:48,041
I see.

227
00:14:54,046 --> 00:14:56,004
It's an illusion.

228
00:14:56,069 --> 00:14:58,071
You tricked me...

229
00:14:58,071 --> 00:15:00,013
Yes.

230
00:15:00,013 --> 00:15:03,022
You've been trying
to get close to me, right?

231
00:15:03,022 --> 00:15:05,014
For someone with their
own winning strategy,

232
00:15:05,014 --> 00:15:08,022
I can just pave a path of victory for them
and they'll easily fall for it.

233
00:15:10,001 --> 00:15:13,018
I want to ask you.
Are you from Q?

234
00:15:13,018 --> 00:15:15,019
Or the Star Religious Group?

235
00:15:38,033 --> 00:15:39,038
Amanai!

236
00:15:45,005 --> 00:15:47,059
W-W-What?

237
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:51,014
Riko, who is he?!
Your boyfriend?

238
00:15:51,014 --> 00:15:54,002
No, he's my cousin!

239
00:15:54,002 --> 00:15:55,006
Not bad, Riko.

240
00:15:55,006 --> 00:15:57,027
I told you he's not my boyfriend!

241
00:15:57,027 --> 00:15:59,065
Is he a high school student?
He's so tall!

242
00:15:59,065 --> 00:16:01,006
Big brother!

243
00:16:01,006 --> 00:16:03,044
Take off your sunglasses!

244
00:16:05,053 --> 00:16:07,003
AHHHH
What a handsome guy!

245
00:16:07,003 --> 00:16:08,053
- Long eyelashes!
- Hi.

246
00:16:08,053 --> 00:16:10,016
Why are his eyes blue?

247
00:16:10,016 --> 00:16:13,004
Strike a pose, please!

248
00:16:13,004 --> 00:16:14,075
Don't get carried away!

249
00:16:14,075 --> 00:16:16,096
Everyone, quiet down.

250
00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:18,092
We are having a class here.

251
00:16:18,092 --> 00:16:21,008
You are interested in him too, Miss!

252
00:16:21,008 --> 00:16:22,042
Don't educate us now.

253
00:16:22,088 --> 00:16:24,018
This is troubling for me.

254
00:16:24,018 --> 00:16:26,067
Even if you're a family member,
you can't just barge in.

255
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:30,047
I'm sorry. This is an emergency.

256
00:16:33,014 --> 00:16:34,089
Here's my phone number.

257
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:36,089
ROAR
That's not fair, Miss!

258
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:39,069
Be quiet! I don't get many
chances to meet the man!

259
00:16:39,069 --> 00:16:42,006
We don't have any chances either!

260
00:16:42,006 --> 00:16:45,003
You like younger guys, Miss!
You can't do that!

261
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:47,003
Are you insulting the Genji family?!

262
00:16:47,003 --> 00:16:48,078
This is a lively school.

263
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:52,007
Idiot, how many times have I told you
not to show up in front of them?

264
00:16:52,061 --> 00:16:55,054
Curse Users are attacking.
I don't need to say anything more, right?

265
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,016
Why am I floating?

266
00:17:03,034 --> 00:17:05,025
We'll go to the high school.

267
00:17:05,071 --> 00:17:08,038
You don't want to involve
your friends, do you?

268
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:12,034
So that's for the bounty
of 30 million yen?

269
00:17:12,034 --> 00:17:14,039
Is that person her classmate?

270
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:16,001
Could be her bodyguard.

271
00:17:16,052 --> 00:17:18,006
This is some easy money.

272
00:17:18,006 --> 00:17:21,002
Kill a non-sorcerer middle school kid
and we can get 30 million yen.

273
00:17:21,002 --> 00:17:22,052
I'll have eel for tonight.

274
00:17:22,052 --> 00:17:24,069
A meal after a murder
is especially delicious.

275
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:27,065
You must be from the Star Religious Group.

276
00:17:27,065 --> 00:17:31,091
Because those from Q
dress more strangely.

277
00:17:32,024 --> 00:17:35,078
Are you an amateur?
If you want to kill, do it secretly.

278
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,001
So slow.

279
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:57,043
I won't let you harm Miss!

280
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:58,093
Or I'll kill you.

281
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:05,001
What?

282
00:18:06,015 --> 00:18:08,019
You're so strong.

283
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,024
Where's Riko?

284
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:13,074
She left the school with Mr. Gojo.

285
00:18:13,074 --> 00:18:16,041
Let's leave too.

286
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:18,095
Things are getting a bit tricky.

287
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:23,000
So that was indeed for
the bounty of 30 million yen.

288
00:18:25,075 --> 00:18:27,025
Shikigami?

289
00:18:27,025 --> 00:18:30,017
No, it's a bit different from Shikigami.

290
00:18:30,017 --> 00:18:31,026
Satoru.

291
00:18:31,051 --> 00:18:34,026
Someone offered a bounty of
30 million yen for killing Amanai?

292
00:18:34,053 --> 00:18:38,035
Yes, it's a limited-time bounty
on an underground website for Curse Users.

293
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:40,095
The deadline seems to be 11 a.m.
the day after tomorrow.

294
00:18:41,052 --> 00:18:43,002
I see.

295
00:18:43,069 --> 00:18:45,098
Two... three... four people.

296
00:18:45,098 --> 00:18:49,044
They all look the same.
Are they Shikigami?

297
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:53,078
Geez. Jujutsu Sorcerers
are always short-handed.

298
00:18:53,078 --> 00:18:56,066
You are welcome to
start a new career, guys.

299
00:18:56,099 --> 00:19:00,004
No thanks. I guess job referrals
aren't easy for you either.

300
00:19:00,004 --> 00:19:02,007
Just hand that kid over to us.

301
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,016
There are five of them now!

302
00:19:04,016 --> 00:19:07,057
What's so good about this little brat?

303
00:19:16,047 --> 00:19:18,018
What was that?

304
00:19:18,047 --> 00:19:20,001
The Shikigami didn't disappear.

305
00:19:20,001 --> 00:19:21,089
Which one is the original?

306
00:19:21,089 --> 00:19:24,031
That's not a Shikigami, it's a clone.

307
00:19:24,068 --> 00:19:26,056
And they're all original.

308
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:32,082
What's going on?

309
00:19:32,082 --> 00:19:33,079
This is infinity.

310
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:35,057
Think about Achilles and the tortoise.

311
00:19:35,057 --> 00:19:36,024
What?

312
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:39,024
What I mean is that studying is important.

313
00:19:40,066 --> 00:19:44,029
It's a Cursed Technique that can summon
up to five clones including the original one.

314
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:48,046
He should be able to choose which one
to be the original at any time.

315
00:19:48,046 --> 00:19:50,038
Once the original is in danger,

316
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:52,008
he'll switch to a safe clone.

317
00:19:53,005 --> 00:19:54,076
Not a bad trick.

318
00:19:55,013 --> 00:19:57,068
But why are you still so weak?
I don't get it.

319
00:19:58,008 --> 00:20:02,014
Clones can't be summoned
temporarily after they are destroyed?

320
00:20:02,014 --> 00:20:04,064
Why do you know my Cursed Technique?

321
00:20:04,064 --> 00:20:08,002
Unfortunately,
I happen to have sharp eyes.

322
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:10,009
My Cursed Technique

323
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:13,086
is the convergence of an infinite series.

324
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:16,057
Things getting closer to me
will be slowed down gradually.

325
00:20:16,057 --> 00:20:19,057
And they'll never touch me.

326
00:20:20,024 --> 00:20:22,074
After being reinforced,
it becomes Limitless.

327
00:20:22,074 --> 00:20:25,058
You could say it's
a negative natural number.

328
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:29,058
It creates a fictional situation
like negative one apple.

329
00:20:29,058 --> 00:20:32,059
In that way, it can achieve
the vacuum reaction just now.

330
00:20:32,059 --> 00:20:34,059
But it's surprisingly inconvenient to use.

331
00:20:35,005 --> 00:20:39,001
One can't make too much
reaction around oneself.

332
00:20:39,001 --> 00:20:41,016
And if you have to
worry about directionality,

333
00:20:41,016 --> 00:20:44,047
controlling Cursed Energy
is a pain in the neck.

334
00:20:44,047 --> 00:20:46,098
Simply put, it's exhausting.

335
00:20:50,052 --> 00:20:54,023
But what I just explained is
about Cursed Technique Lapse.

336
00:20:56,032 --> 00:20:58,032
Protect your head.

337
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:17,059
This is the divergence of infinity.

338
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:21,005
Cursed Technique Reversal.

339
00:21:22,093 --> 00:21:23,055
Red.

340
00:21:38,086 --> 00:21:40,036
I failed!

341
00:21:50,033 --> 00:21:53,009
I thought it should work.

342
00:21:54,038 --> 00:21:56,002
What's wrong with this guy?

343
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,059
Kuroi is calling.

344
00:22:03,051 --> 00:22:05,008
What should I do?
Kuroi...

345
00:22:06,026 --> 00:22:07,043
Kuroi is...

346
00:23:40,048 --> 00:23:42,007
To express the voice of
the younger generation,

347
00:23:42,007 --> 00:23:44,078
I vote in every election.

348
00:23:44,078 --> 00:23:48,026
But I can't help but worry
if I can still be considered young.

349
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:49,074
