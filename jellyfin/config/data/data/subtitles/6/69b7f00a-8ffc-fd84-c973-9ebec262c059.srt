His planet is in crisis.
His people are starving.

Oh, I've missed you so much.

00:02:38,595 --> 00:02:41,178
I was afraid you might not come.

46
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:44,095
We are such a small and humble system.

47
00:02:44,178 --> 00:02:47,303
Uncle Ono, you are very important to me.

48
00:02:47,387 --> 00:02:49,679
We've been friends
since I was a little girl,

49
00:02:49,762 --> 00:02:52,261
when you were my father's
strongest ally in the Senate.

50
00:02:52,345 --> 00:02:55,095
Rodia is very important to the Republic,

51
00:02:55,178 --> 00:02:57,095
and of course, I'd come to help you.

52
00:02:57,178 --> 00:03:00,470
You speak of friendship
I have not witnessed of late.

53
00:03:00,553 --> 00:03:01,679
Where was the Republic

54
00:03:01,804 --> 00:03:04,387
when our supply ships
were destroyed by pirates?

55
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,929
Where was the Republic
as my people starved?

56
00:03:08,011 --> 00:03:11,261
We have been stranded out here

57
00:03:11,345 --> 00:03:13,637
without any help at all.

58
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,512
I know it is not your fault,

59
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:18,762
but my people starve all the same.

60
00:03:18,845 --> 00:03:21,512
I'm sure the Republic Senate
will approve a relief effort.

61
00:03:21,595 --> 00:03:25,428
The vote was postponed,
but you will get your food.

62
00:03:25,512 --> 00:03:29,970
I am sorry. It is too late, my sweet.

63
00:03:30,053 --> 00:03:32,595
The Separatist leader Nute Gunray

64
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,178
has promised to support us

65
00:03:34,261 --> 00:03:37,053

and protection.

68
00:03:44,595 --> 00:03:47,595
Nute Gunray cannot be trusted.

69
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:51,136
He will bring war to your system
just as he did to mine many years ago.

70
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,929
I am afraid I have already done
what I must for my people.

and you are part of it.

-Stop her.
-Three--

77
00:04:18,178 --> 00:04:20,512
No one can help you now.

78
00:04:20,595 --> 00:04:24,553
I am so sorry, my sweet. I had no choice.

79
00:04:24,637 --> 00:04:26,136
There's always a choice.

80
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,220
To live in fear is no life at all.

81
00:04:28,303 --> 00:04:29,261
Take her away!

82
00:04:29,345 --> 00:04:32,428
Please, Uncle Ono, don't do this.

83
00:04:32,512 --> 00:04:35,553
You have made a wise decision, senator.

84
00:04:35,637 --> 00:04:40,220
I will be there within the hour
to bring food for your people

85
00:04:40,303 --> 00:04:42,887

00:04:48,637 --> 00:04:52,720

doesn't have a very high opinion of us.

Keep moving, prisoner.

Oh, no. Jar Jar's been killed.

141

I knew something like this would happen.

142
00:07:20,178 --> 00:07:23,303
What a horrible way to die,
and it's all my fault.

143
00:07:23,387 --> 00:07:27,970
He was so brave. Now he's gone forever.

Meesa OK, 3-So. Meesa OK.

147
00:07:36,428 --> 00:07:40,428

Ouch!

151
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:46,679
Jar Jar, kindly don't do that.

152

Oh, dear.

156
00:07:55,178 --> 00:07:57,929
Well, that's the end of our ship. Typical.

157
00:08:05,637 --> 00:08:07,428
Are those chains necessary?

158
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,387
Welcome to the Separatist way, senator.

159
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,303
Viceroy Gunray's orders.

160
00:08:14,011 --> 00:08:16,178
I hope it's worth it to you.

161
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:20,553
Thisa one big mess.
Weesa going nowhere.

162
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,011
Perhaps we should try
to contact the clone troopers.

163
00:08:25,095 --> 00:08:25,970
Oh, lookee.

164
00:08:26,053 --> 00:08:27,804

I wouldn't, um, know.

171
00:08:40,595 --> 00:08:43,345
But our only hope is to hide
in this closet

172
00:08:43,428 --> 00:08:45,553
until Mistress Padm√© returns.

173
00:08:45,637 --> 00:08:49,387
If those droids attackin' us,
Padm√©'s probably in trouble.

174
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,679
My lady gave us very specific
instructions to remain here.

175
00:08:53,762 --> 00:08:54,929
Oh, fiddlesticks.

176
00:08:55,011 --> 00:08:56,887
We musta hafta try and savin' her.

177
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:59,387
Jar Jar Binks, have you
gone completely mad?

178
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,303
You'll do more harm than good.

179
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:06,053
Viceroy Gunray,
goo-bee un-un hah-tah.

180
00:09:06,136 --> 00:09:09,011
Good. I shall meet
the viceroy when he lands.

181
00:09:10,053 --> 00:09:12,387
What about Senator Amidala's companions?

182
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,929
Saw-yed ree-wah, nahga-vee-to ko.

183
00:09:16,011 --> 00:09:18,095
If there are no signs of her friends,

184
00:09:18,178 --> 00:09:20,470
they must have fled into the jungle.

185
00:09:20,553 --> 00:09:22,845
Yes, this is perfect.

186
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,720
I want no sign of trouble.

187
00:09:24,804 --> 00:09:27,512
Our people need those supplies.

188
00:09:27,595 --> 00:09:30,387
Wait. Meesa eyeball's stuck in the sleeve.

189
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:31,637
Just look at you.

190
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,136
Something's wrongo here.

191
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,637
The battle droids will surely
capture you, or worse, me.

192
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,220
Not with thisa on.

193
00:09:39,303 --> 00:09:40,970
Theysa won't be recognizing me.

194
00:09:41,053 --> 00:09:42,470
You can't be serious.

195
00:09:42,553 --> 00:09:45,053
Come on, 3-So, we can do it.

196
00:09:45,136 --> 00:09:47,470
I have a very bad feeling about this.

197
00:09:59,303 --> 00:10:02,261
The citizens of Rodia
welcome you, viceroy.

198
00:10:02,345 --> 00:10:04,720
Where is Senator Amidala?

199
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:07,637
Awaiting your arrival, as promised.

200
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,845
Excellent.

201
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:11,136
I do not wish to keep her waiting.

202
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,428
Shall we go?

203
00:10:13,387 --> 00:10:16,303
We are holding the senator
in the detention tower.

204
00:10:16,387 --> 00:10:19,345
I hope it is not too painful for her.

205
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,387
Sheesa up in that tower?
Weesa got to rescuin' her.

206
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,387
And how precisely
do you propose to do that?

207
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,261
Look, a Jedi.

208
00:10:34,345 --> 00:10:35,428
We're doomed.

209
00:10:35,512 --> 00:10:36,595
A Jedi?

210
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,679
Jedi? Where's a Jedi?

211
00:10:38,762 --> 00:10:40,637
<i>I do believe they mean you.</i>

212
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,970
Meesa not a Jedi.

213
00:10:42,053 --> 00:10:43,512
Kill the Jedi.

214
00:10:43,595 --> 00:10:45,470
Don't shoot, we surrender. We surrender.

215
00:10:45,553 --> 00:10:48,095
Ah! Forget surrender. Weesa run.

216
00:10:52,845 --> 00:10:54,220
Jar Jar.

217
00:10:57,887 --> 00:10:59,220
Is he dead?

218
00:10:59,303 --> 00:11:00,845
The Jedi got away.

219
00:11:00,929 --> 00:11:03,804
He slipped through this grate
and went underwater.

220
00:11:10,345 --> 00:11:13,178
Sound the alarm. Find that Jedi.

221
00:11:13,261 --> 00:11:16,345
I can see you're busy,
so I'll just be going now.

222
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:20,387
And take that Republic droid scum
to the dismantling center.

223
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,929
Dismantling center?

224
00:11:22,053 --> 00:11:23,762
Oh, wait. Wait, I'm innocent.

225
00:11:23,845 --> 00:11:25,303
I'm innocent, I tell you.

226
00:11:30,637 --> 00:11:31,845
[low rumble]

227
00:11:35,845 --> 00:11:37,428
[screams]

228
00:11:37,512 --> 00:11:39,720
[growling]

229
00:11:41,553 --> 00:11:43,428
Let's find that Jedi.

230
00:11:43,512 --> 00:11:44,428
-Roger, roger.
-Roger, roger.

231
00:11:44,512 --> 00:11:45,387
-Roger, roger.
-Roger, roger.

232
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,637
Roger, roger.

233
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:50,053
Take me to Senator Amidala at once.

234
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:03,303
There's a bad boogie monster
down there, you betcha.

235
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:07,470
Don't be fearing, Padm√©. Meesa coming.

236
00:12:10,345 --> 00:12:11,637
[beeping]

237
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,512
Better watch out.
There's a Jedi on the loose.

238
00:12:14,595 --> 00:12:15,845
[both] Uh-oh.

239
00:12:16,887 --> 00:12:19,303
You know, you will soon be destroyed.

240
00:12:19,387 --> 00:12:20,470
I can't tell you how many times

241
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:23,845
I've seen battle droids
sliced in half by a lone Jedi.

242
00:12:24,345 --> 00:12:25,345
Quiet, you.

243
00:12:25,428 --> 00:12:27,178
All right, cut the chatter.

244
00:12:27,261 --> 00:12:30,261
I want you troops to go outside
and secure the perimeter.

245
00:12:30,345 --> 00:12:32,387
[Padm√©] You made it! I'm rescued at last.

246
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:36,178
Hurry, before the battle droids
figure out what's happening.

247
00:12:36,261 --> 00:12:38,637
[clinking]

248
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,261
Quiet in there.

249
00:12:40,345 --> 00:12:41,512
[Padm√©] Thank you.

250
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,804
Let's get out of here, Master Jedi.

251
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:44,804
Jedi?

252
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,303
There's no Jedi in here.

253
00:12:50,387 --> 00:12:52,845
Wait, there's no prisoner in here.

254
00:12:52,929 --> 00:12:54,387
How did she do that?

255
00:12:55,512 --> 00:12:58,053
-[grunts]
-[shouting]

256
00:12:58,804 --> 00:13:00,595
-[blaster fires]
-Where's the alarm button?

257
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:01,762
Oh!

258
00:13:15,387 --> 00:13:19,387
I am a protocol droid,
fluent in over six million forms of--

259
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:20,470
Quiet.

260
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,637
-3PO.
-Mistress Padm√©!

261
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,762
Oh, thank the Maker you're safe.

262
00:13:30,845 --> 00:13:31,845
Have you--?

263
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,011
Where's Jar Jar?

264
00:13:36,095 --> 00:13:39,095
Well, I'm afraid he went to rescue you.

265
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,303
Hmm.

266
00:13:40,512 --> 00:13:41,679
Well, what about the Jedi?

267
00:13:41,762 --> 00:13:43,136
There is no Jedi.

268
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,595
It appears the battle droids
have mistaken Jar Jar for one.

269
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:48,011
That's not good.

270
00:13:49,011 --> 00:13:51,095
Hang on, my lady.

271
00:13:51,178 --> 00:13:53,428
This is our chance to capture
Viceroy Gunray,

272
00:13:53,512 --> 00:13:55,011
but I need you to stay calm.

273
00:13:55,095 --> 00:13:57,345
Go back to the ship and call for help.

274
00:13:57,428 --> 00:14:00,637
I regret the transmitters
on the ship are out of order.

275
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,387
-What?
-The ship has been destroyed.

276
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,178
-Battle droids?
-No.

277
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,970
-Jar Jar?
-Jar Jar.

278
00:14:07,053 --> 00:14:10,804
All right, then find a communications room
and send out a distress signal.

279
00:14:10,887 --> 00:14:13,220
Hopefully, there are some
clone ships within range.

280
00:14:13,303 --> 00:14:14,720
I'll track down Jar Jar.

281
00:14:23,553 --> 00:14:27,679
Viceroy Gunray, when can we
expect the supplies to arrive?

282
00:14:27,762 --> 00:14:29,720
My people are starving.

283
00:14:29,804 --> 00:14:31,637
They haven't arrived yet?

284
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,845
I'm sorry.

285
00:14:32,929 --> 00:14:35,261
Your request will be
taken into consideration

286
00:14:35,345 --> 00:14:38,053
after Senator Amidala's execution.

287
00:14:38,136 --> 00:14:41,011
Execution? You can't.

288
00:14:41,095 --> 00:14:43,595
She's a prisoner of war. We were promised.

289
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:45,637
You are under my protection now,

290
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,929
and you will do what I demand of you.

291
00:14:52,804 --> 00:14:54,762
Gunray, muh-skee-oh-tee.

292
00:14:54,845 --> 00:14:56,470
Padm√© was right.

293
00:14:56,553 --> 00:15:00,095
I have made a grave mistake
joining with the Separatists.

294
00:15:00,178 --> 00:15:01,887
Cho-aht-dee-vah-tay.

295
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,637
I know. I know.

296
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,845
We must appease Viceroy Gunray
so he does not destroy us all.

297
00:15:08,553 --> 00:15:12,679
Be on alert for that Jedi.
He is our only hope.

298
00:15:20,011 --> 00:15:22,762
Bring Senator Amidala before me.

299
00:15:22,845 --> 00:15:26,345
Um, she caused a great deal
of damage to our droids,

300
00:15:26,428 --> 00:15:28,220
and she escaped, sir.

301
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,428
-Escaped?
-It's the Jedi!

302
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:32,261
-Sir!
-Shoot him!

303
00:15:33,136 --> 00:15:34,637
Ah, whoa!

304
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,845
Wha-ha!

305
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:48,553
Thisa rescuin' is hard jobbin'.

306
00:15:48,637 --> 00:15:49,595
Whoa!

307
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,053
Jar Jar!

308
00:15:59,595 --> 00:16:00,637
Capture her!

309
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,011
[blasters firing]

310
00:16:05,178 --> 00:16:06,553
[beeping]

311
00:16:06,637 --> 00:16:07,929
[blasters firing]

312
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,887
[beeping]

313
00:16:18,595 --> 00:16:20,679
[muffled explosion]

314
00:16:20,762 --> 00:16:21,887
Oh, dear.

315
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,178
Uh...

316
00:16:23,261 --> 00:16:25,595
The Jedi has been spotted
in the south hall.

317
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:26,679
Let's move.

318
00:16:26,762 --> 00:16:27,929
Roger, roger.

319
00:16:29,345 --> 00:16:31,512
I think that was rather clever.

320
00:16:34,595 --> 00:16:36,053
Sir, over there!

321
00:16:36,136 --> 00:16:37,720
The Jedi is escaping.

322
00:16:37,804 --> 00:16:39,470
Not likely.

323
00:16:45,428 --> 00:16:46,595
[blasters firing]

324
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:53,512
[roars]

325
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,428
-Freeze.
-Surrender.

326
00:16:59,887 --> 00:17:01,303
Where did she go?

327
00:17:02,095 --> 00:17:03,053
What the--?

328
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:15,428
[explosion]

329
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:18,595
Jar Jar... no.

330
00:17:19,595 --> 00:17:21,345
Senator Amidala.

331
00:17:22,637 --> 00:17:25,637
So good to see you at last.

332
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,470
Hello? I say, is anyone there?

333
00:17:31,595 --> 00:17:34,220
Why is there never an R2 unit
when you need one?

334
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,804
<i>This is a restricted frequency.</i>
<i>Who is this?</i>

335
00:17:36,887 --> 00:17:40,011
-I am C-3PO, human-cyborg--
<i>-No droids.</i>

336
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,595
<i>This code is for military use only.</i>

337
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,637
This is a priority message
from Senator Amidala on Rodia.

338
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,970
-We require immediate assist--
-Hold it.

339
00:17:48,053 --> 00:17:48,929
Oh, oh, dear.

340
00:17:49,011 --> 00:17:50,595
You're under arrest.

341
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:53,470
So you didn't find the Jedi, then?

342
00:17:53,553 --> 00:17:54,929
You got him, boss.

343
00:17:55,512 --> 00:17:57,845
Too bad you can't take out
that slug monster.

344
00:18:03,387 --> 00:18:05,095
[belch]

345
00:18:05,178 --> 00:18:06,720
Yousa OK, Bogey?

346
00:18:06,804 --> 00:18:09,679
Yousa save-ed me. Yousa my new palo.

347
00:18:12,387 --> 00:18:14,011
[affectionate grumbling]

348
00:18:14,095 --> 00:18:17,637
Mistress Padm√©, oh,
were you able to find Jar Jar?

349
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,845
I think Jar Jar's dead, 3PO.

350
00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:22,720
Not again. Oh, poor Jar Jar.

351
00:18:22,804 --> 00:18:25,095
He was always such a misfit.

352
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,720
I want to make sure this time.

353
00:18:31,804 --> 00:18:33,679
Don't do this, viceroy.

354
00:18:33,762 --> 00:18:37,637
I beg you, do not kill her.
There must be another way.

355
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,178
Silence!

356
00:18:39,261 --> 00:18:42,845
I say, I think there has been
some horrible mistake.

357
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:45,470
I am a protocol droid on a diplomatic--

358
00:18:45,553 --> 00:18:46,512
Ready!

359
00:18:48,387 --> 00:18:49,428
Aim.

360
00:18:54,011 --> 00:18:55,387
It's the Jedi!

361
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,261
It's the J-J-Je--

362
00:18:59,345 --> 00:19:00,178
Jedi.

363
00:19:00,261 --> 00:19:01,970
Release the senator.

364
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:04,470
Uh, that Jedi is going to attack.

365
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,261
Shoot him! Shoot them all!

366
00:19:08,136 --> 00:19:09,679
Whoa!

367
00:19:10,553 --> 00:19:13,136
[shouting]

368
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,345
That Jedi has summoned a monster.

369
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,887
[roaring]

370
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,470
We have to get out of here.

371
00:19:32,553 --> 00:19:33,679
[blaster fires]

372
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:35,679
[gasps]

373
00:19:35,762 --> 00:19:38,220
Whoa!

374
00:19:44,261 --> 00:19:46,136
[roars]

375
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,470
I made a very good friend.

376
00:19:49,553 --> 00:19:51,470
Hold it right there, viceroy.

377
00:19:53,387 --> 00:19:56,387
At last, we can finish this.

378
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,929
Onaconda, it is about time.

379
00:19:59,011 --> 00:20:01,845
Blast that Jedi and shoot her!

380
00:20:08,887 --> 00:20:10,804
Uncle Ono, I think it's time

381
00:20:10,887 --> 00:20:13,553
to tell the viceroy
about our little secret,

382
00:20:13,637 --> 00:20:16,053
how you never meant to leave the Republic

383
00:20:16,136 --> 00:20:18,679
and how you truly care
what's best for your people.

384
00:20:18,762 --> 00:20:20,762
What is she talking about?

385
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:23,512
Sorry, viceroy, she is right.

386
00:20:23,637 --> 00:20:27,970
I am with the Republic,
and you are under arrest.

387
00:20:28,053 --> 00:20:31,720
You will pay for this treachery.

388
00:20:31,804 --> 00:20:33,720
Viceroy, you are going to spend

389
00:20:33,804 --> 00:20:35,303
the rest of the war in a cell.

390
00:20:35,387 --> 00:20:38,220
Your victory will be fleeting, senators.

391
00:20:41,095 --> 00:20:42,512
[engines rumbling]

392
00:20:42,595 --> 00:20:46,762
Those are Republic warships.
The clones have arrived.

393
00:20:50,095 --> 00:20:51,470
We got your message, general.

394
00:20:51,553 --> 00:20:53,136
What are your orders?

395
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,387
My message got through.

396
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,679
Take this Separatist scum away.

397
00:20:58,387 --> 00:20:59,679
Master Bombad...

398
00:20:59,762 --> 00:21:02,887
on behalf of the people of Rodia,
I thank you.

399
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:08,011
You're either the bravest
or the most foolish Jedi I have ever met.

400
00:21:08,095 --> 00:21:10,887
I'm just a Gungan,
and I don't think I'm either.

401
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:13,929
Well, I think you're a...
a little bit of both.

402
00:21:16,845 --> 00:21:19,470
<i>Senator Amidala has brought</i>
<i>your people's needs</i>

403
00:21:19,553 --> 00:21:22,095
<i>to my attention, and I have already sent</i>

404
00:21:22,178 --> 00:21:24,637
<i>a convoy of supply ships to your system.</i>

405
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,303
Thank you, chancellor.

406
00:21:26,387 --> 00:21:27,720
<i>The capture of Viceroy Gunray</i>

407
00:21:27,804 --> 00:21:29,762
<i>is a major victory for the Republic.</i>

408
00:21:30,178 --> 00:21:32,512
<i>All of you should be commended</i>
<i>for your courage</i>

409
00:21:32,595 --> 00:21:33,720
<i>and from what I hear,</i>

410
00:21:33,804 --> 00:21:36,345
<i>especially you, Representative Binks.</i>

411
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,053
Ah, it'sa nothing.

412
00:21:38,136 --> 00:21:40,679
[grumbles]

413
00:21:40,762 --> 00:21:43,011
Can you ever forgive me, Padm√©?

414
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:46,512
It is the Republic that should be asking
your forgiveness, my old friend.

415
00:21:46,595 --> 00:21:50,136
Far too often, we forget
that our most important allies

416
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,261
are not always the most powerful.

417
00:21:52,345 --> 00:21:54,428
[roars]

418
00:21:54,512 --> 00:21:56,553
[orchestral fanfare]

419
00:21:59,387 --> 00:22:01,387
[<i>Star Wars </i>theme playing]
