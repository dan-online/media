00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,200
<font size="36">Ooh, here we are.</font>

00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,760

7
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,440
<font size="36">Good night.</font>

8
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,080
<font size="36">Er... I'll just walk you
to the door.</font>

9
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,920
<font size="36">There's no need. It's fine.
I can get there on my own.</font>

10
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,960
<font size="36">So...</font>

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,040
<font size="36">I guess this is arrividerci.</font>

12
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,320
<font size="36">I quite fancy a cup of tea, though.</font>

13
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,560
<font size="36">Glass of water, maybe?</font>

14
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,760
<font size="36">Perhaps a little lie down.</font>

15
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,480
<font size="36">Look, I have to tell you something.</font>

16
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,080
<font size="36">What?</font>

17
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,800
<font size="36">I wanted to say it in
the restaurant but...</font>

18
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,040
<font size="36">a good time never came up
and I wasn't going to say it,</font>

19
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,000
<font size="36">but I have to. Er...</font>

20
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,160
<font size="36">What?</font>

21
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,280
<font size="36">You've got shit on your head.</font>

22
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,160
<font size="36">What?</font>

23
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,800
<font size="36">There's some shit on your head.</font>

24
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,080
<font size="36">Where?</font>

25
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,120
<font size="36">Where? Where?</font>

26
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,000
<font size="36">It's been there for ages.</font>

27
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,000
<font size="36">Oh, God!</font>

28
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,560
<font size="36">Oh, God!</font>

29
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,400
<font size="36">It's chocolate.
It's chocolate. It's not shit.</font>

30
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,120
<font size="36">It's not shit. It's my dessert.</font>

31
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,120
<font size="36">I don't know how it got
there but it's on my fingers.</font>

32
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,880
<font size="36">It's not shit.</font>

33
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,800
<font size="36">Thank God for that!</font>

34
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,440
<font size="36">Do you know, I've just spent
the last hour thinking you were</font>

35
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,520
<font size="36">some sort of disgusting tramp.</font>

36
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,640
<font size="36">Oooh, no!</font>

37
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,080
<font size="36">That's funny.</font>

38
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,680
<font size="36">Ha haaa!</font>

39
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,480
<font size="36">Oh... It's not. It's chocolate!</font>

40
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,960
<font size="36">Aah. How about that cup of tea now?</font>

41
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,480
<font size="36">I was a perfect gentleman last
night from beginning to end,</font>

42
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,360
<font size="36">but she can't see past a little
bit of shit on my forehead.</font>

43
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,600
<font size="36">I thought you said it was chocolate.</font>

44
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,720
<font size="36">Yes, chocolate, I meant chocolate.</font>

45
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,960
<font size="36">PHONE RINGS</font>

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,880
<font size="36">I forgot to turn this thing on.</font>

47
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,800
<font size="36">Hello, IT.</font>

48
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,600
<font size="36">'Hi, something's wrong
with my computer.'</font>

49
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,680
<font size="36">'Have you tried
turning it off and on again?'</font>

50
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,000
<font size="36">'No, I'll do that, thanks.'</font>

51
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,640
<font size="36">'You're welcome, mate.'</font>

52
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,440
<font size="36">You know, it's typical.</font>

53
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,520
<font size="36">The one time I manage to bamboozle
a girl in the building into going
out with me and this happens.</font>

54
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,480
<font size="36">Oh, she's going to tell everyone.</font>

55
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,040
<font size="36">Oh, come on, she's a receptionist.</font>

56
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,440
<font size="36">She'd hardly gossip.</font>

57
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,760
<font size="36">Besides, it's a boring story.</font>

58
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,680
<font size="36">Yeah, yeah, it's boring.</font>

59
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,560
<font size="36">It's boring. She won't tell anyone.</font>

60
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,160
<font size="36">SCREAMS OF LAUGHTER ></font>

61
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,480
<font size="36">'Ello...</font>

62
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,120
<font size="36">Sorry.</font>

63
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,640
<font size="36">She might have told Jen.</font>

64
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,920
<font size="36">No, no, that's what I'm saying.</font>

65
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,520
<font size="36">It wasn't. It WAS chocolate.</font>

66
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,520
<font size="36">It was chocolate. I don't know!</font>

67
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,320
<font size="36">It got on my
fingers and then I must have...</font>

68
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,120
<font size="36">Listen, how did you
even hear about this, Mum?</font>

69
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,000
<font size="36">Moss, Moss, there's a spider in my
office. Could you deal with it?</font>

70
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,200
<font size="36">I just hate spiders.</font>

71
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:28,000
<font size="36">Oh, ah, yeah, I'm not overly
fond of them myself there, Jen.</font>

72
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,560
<font size="36">Um, how...</font>

73
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,280
<font size="36">How big is... Whoa, hey now!</font>

74
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,720
<font size="36">I tell you what, I'd actually
recommend my good friend Roy there</font>

75
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,680
<font size="36">as the go-to guy on anything
with more than seven eyes.</font>

76
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,120
<font size="36">He's on a very brief
personal call right now.</font>

77
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,640
<font size="36">Come on, Moss, don't be silly.</font>

78
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,080
<font size="36">You're right, I'm being silly.
Wrap it up, Roy!</font>

79
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,920
<font size="36">It's just a spider. It's fine!</font>

80
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,480
<font size="36">It's just a spider.</font>

81
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,040
<font size="36">Oh, look! It seems to have
left of its own volition.</font>

82
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,080
<font size="36">Oh, be a man, Moss.</font>

83
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,040
<font size="36">You're right, I'll be a man.</font>

84
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,720
<font size="36">I'm a man.</font>

85
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,720
<font size="36">Please don't shut the door.</font>

86
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,720
<font size="36">I won't.</font>

87
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,400
<font size="36">Goodbye, Jen.</font>

88
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,120
<font size="36">That was my mother.</font>

89
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,000
<font size="36">How did she hear about it?</font>

90
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:20,440
<font size="36">Oh, was that the woman who phoned
earlier, I've been telling everyone.</font>

91
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,960
<font size="36">Why would you want
to go out with Patricia anyway?</font>

92
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,920
<font size="36">Her last boyfriend
was Simon from third.</font>

93
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,800
<font size="36">Jen? ></font>

94
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,880
<font size="36">Heya!</font>

95
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,280
<font size="36">Hello there. ></font>

96
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,960
<font size="36">Have you caught it yet?</font>

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,960
<font size="36">Not quite Jen. ></font>

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,200
<font size="36">The spider's managed to walk behind
me and it's between me and the door.</font>

99
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,160
<font size="36">So I can't get out.</font>

100
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,960
<font size="36">Simon from third is
the one with the hair.</font>

101
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,360
<font size="36">Oh, him! Oh, he's awful.</font>

102
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,680
<font size="36">He once ate a copy
of Loaded for a bet.</font>

103
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,480
<font size="36">She liked him?!</font>

104
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,680
<font size="36">Apparently.</font>

105
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,480
<font size="36">I mean, that explains everything.</font>

106
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,400
<font size="36">She likes the kind of big,
obnoxious guy who eats Loaded.</font>

107
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,720
<font size="36">Hello, Daniel.
How are you?</font>

108
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,080
<font size="36">Oh, I'm great, thanks. How are you?</font>

109
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,560
<font size="36">I'm great.</font>

110
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:14,480
<font size="36">Can either of you tell me, OK, OK,
who wrote Missa Brevis in D Minor?</font>

111
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,200
<font size="36">Was it Mozart or Beethoven?</font>

112
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,600
<font size="36">That was a certain Mr Mozart,
I think you'll find.</font>

113
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,960
<font size="36">Oh, do you know a lot
about classical music?</font>

114
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,360
<font size="36">Un petit pois.</font>

115
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,400
<font size="36">Oh, right.</font>

116
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,600
<font size="36">Mozart, Beethoven. 50-50, innit?</font>

117
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,360
<font size="36">Actually, you were right.</font>

118
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,200
<font size="36">It was, it was Mozart.</font>

119
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,600
<font size="36">OK, so, let's try another one.</font>

120
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:42,920
<font size="36">OK, here we are - in what year did
Mozart die? Was it 1780 or 1791?</font>

121
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,160
<font size="36">91.</font>

122
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:48,400
<font size="36">Yes, yes! Bang on! Wow.</font>

123
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,120
<font size="36">God, I hope he
doesn't come in again.</font>

124
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,800
<font size="36">Jen? ></font>

125
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,960
<font size="36">Yes?</font>

126
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,880
<font size="36">Is Roy off the phone yet?
The spider is now upon my person. ></font>

127
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,000
<font size="36">You guys don't mind me
chilling out in here, do you?</font>

128
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,960
<font size="36">No, chill out!</font>

129
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,560
<font size="36">Did you see the match last night?</font>

130
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,760
<font size="36">Oh, yeah!</font>

131
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,960
<font size="36">Oh, yeah! God...</font>

132
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,240
<font size="36">Did we?! Wow! What a match!</font>

133
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,600
<font size="36">Yeah!</font>

134
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,680
<font size="36">Oh, all of the players running up
the pitch.</font>

135
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,480
<font size="36">Running and...</font>

136
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,960
<font size="36">And running down it again.
Such athleticism!</font>

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,920
<font size="36">What was Rooney thinking of though?</font>

138
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,720
<font size="36">Who knows?</font>

139
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,400
<font size="36">That Rooney...</font>

140
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,360
<font size="36">He is a foolish boy.</font>

141
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,480
<font size="36">Yeah, but that referee. I'm sorry,
the referee is just an idiot.</font>

142
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:48,080
<font size="36">Yes, he was certainly
the villain of the piece.</font>

143
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,560
<font size="36">Oh, Daniel. You're still here.</font>

144
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,280
<font size="36">Yeah, just having a little break.</font>

145
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,080
<font size="36">Do you want to come and join me?</font>

146
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,840
<font size="36">Ha ha ha! Oh, stop it!</font>

147
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,480
<font size="36">Well, I'd better... Anyway, cheers.</font>

148
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,400
<font size="36">Oh, by the way, guys, if you need
any help with any more spiders,</font>

149
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,000

<font size="36">If your date proved anything,</font>

165
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,080
<font size="36">it's that women like men without
poo on their foreheads.</font>

but all women just want bastards.</font>

They want bullies and thugs.</font>

179
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,240
<font size="36">How will you prove it to me, Roy?</font>

180
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,120
<font size="36">Oh, OK, I'll put

get a bezillion replies.</font>

I thought that thing was broken.</font>

for dinner with me?</font>

213
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,200

214
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,880
<font size="36">I'd love to, Jen, but I'm
actually helping Roy at the moment.</font>

I'll go out with you, Daniel!</font>

295
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,560
<font size="36">'Yes, that's great, Jen. Right, let
me fill you in on what's happening.</font>

296
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,000
<font size="36">'Daniel's doing very well,
although he has just used his 50-50.</font>

297
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,360
<font size="36">'Here's Daniel. Daniel, you've
got 30 seconds starting from now.</font>

298
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,880
<font size="36">'OK, Jen.'</font>

299
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,040
<font size="36">Hello, Daniel.</font>

300
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,560
<font size="36">'Hi, Jen, hi, Jen.
Who composed The Wooden Prince?</font>

301
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,240
<font size="36">'Was it A, Bartok, B, Chopin?'</font>

302
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,400
<font size="36">Did you see
I'm A Millionaire last night?</font>

303
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,640
<font size="36">Who Wants To Be A Millionaire,
it's called. No, I didn't.</font>

304
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,680
<font size="36">You are not going to
Adam and believe this.</font>

305
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,680
<font size="36">Do these make me look like a bastard?</font>

306
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,680
<font size="36">Why do you wanna
look like a bastard?</font>

307
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,520
<font size="36">I've got that date tonight,</font>

308
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,720
<font size="36">she's expecting a monster.
Do these make me look like a bastard?</font>

309
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,520
<font size="36">They make you look like an idiot.</font>

310
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,960
<font size="36">Anyway, did you see it? ></font>

311
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,720
<font size="36">What?</font>

312
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,760
<font size="36">Do You Want To Be A Millionaire.</font>

313
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,680
<font size="36">Who Wants To Be A Millionaire!</font>

314
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,240
<font size="36">Ah! Who wants to be
a person who is wrong?</font>

315
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,440
<font size="36">Whoa, whoa, what's happened?</font>

316
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,280
<font size="36">If I may?</font>

317
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,040
<font size="36">Sure.</font>

318
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,760
<font size="36">Guess who was on it last night.</font>

319
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,120
<font size="36">You?</font>

320
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,320
<font size="36">No, Daniel, king of men.</font>

321
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,160
<font size="36">Daniel was on Millionaire?!</font>

322
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,560
<font size="36">Indeed he was. And it was the
"do you want to phone a friend..."</font>

323
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,480
<font size="36">BOTH: It's just Phone A Friend.</font>

324
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,280
<font size="36">Anyway...</font>

325
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,200
<font size="36">She was the Phone A Friend?</font>

326
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,120
<font size="36">She was the Phone A Friend.</font>

327
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,360
<font size="36">You were the Phone A Friend!
Oh, what was the subject?</font>

328
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,240
<font size="36">Classical music is the extraordinary</font>

329
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:45,280
<font size="36">answer to that question, so who,
of course, is Daniel, our esteemed</font>

330
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,160
<font size="36">temp security guard, going to phone
but Jonathan Miller over here?</font>

331
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,320
<font size="36">Daniel was on Millionaire.</font>

332
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,200
<font size="36">Too bad it wasn't 50-50.</font>

333
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,640
<font size="36">It was.</font>

334
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,240
<font size="36">And?</font>

335
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,040
<font size="36">I got it wrong.</font>

336
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,000
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

337
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:03,840
<font size="36">It isn't funny though.
Now I have to go on a date with him.</font>

338
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,480
<font size="36">Wow, the rules on that show
have really changed!</font>

339
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,680
<font size="36">You don't understand!</font>

340
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,960
<font size="36">He asked me out on the show
before I got the question wrong.</font>

341
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,920
<font size="36">It was all very romantic. But now,
I don't think he likes me now!</font>

342
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,200
<font size="36">And I don't want to go out with
the biggest loser in England!</font>

343
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,920
<font size="36">There you are, Daniel.</font>

344
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,400
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

345
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,400
<font size="36">Hiya.</font>

346
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,560
<font size="36">We gonna go for this meal, then?</font>

347
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,920
<font size="36">Yeah. Yeah, I can't wait.</font>

348
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,200
<font size="36">I'm going to take you to
one of my favourite restaurants.</font>

349
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,760
<font size="36">Great.</font>

350
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,200
<font size="36">I'll pay.</font>

351
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,800
<font size="36">It really is the least I can do.</font>

352
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,120
<font size="36">Oh, my God.
Did you see that look?</font>

353
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,120
<font size="36">I have a dinner date with that man.</font>

354
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,200
<font size="36">If I'm not here tomorrow,
I want you to call the police.</font>

355
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,080
<font size="36">Maybe not the best time to
mention it, but you owe me 20 quid.</font>

356
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,960
<font size="36">What? You got a response?!</font>

357
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,720
<font size="36">With the one that ended, "No dogs"?</font>

358
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,760
<font size="36">Yep.</font>

359
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,000
<font size="36">Oh, my God,
brilliant, more money gone.</font>

360
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,480
<font size="36">The money that Daniel lost
wasn't really yours.</font>

361
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,800
<font size="36">It would have been if
I'd married him, Moss.</font>

362
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,440
<font size="36">OK, I need a good restaurant.</font>

363
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,080
<font size="36">Maybe if he likes the food, he
won't beat me to death with a shoe.</font>

364
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,080
<font size="36">You said you were taking him to one
of your favourite restaurants.</font>

365
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,560
<font size="36">Haven't you got it yet?</font>

366
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,280
<font size="36">That's what I do, I lie.</font>

367
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,480
<font size="36">I lie and I lie - and I lie.</font>

368
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,680
<font size="36">I went to a good place recently.</font>

369
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,400
<font size="36">Nice atmosphere. Food's great.</font>

370
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,480
<font size="36">Really?</font>

371
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,000
<font size="36">Yes, what?</font>

372
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,480
<font size="36">Sorry, I just didn't have you down
as a restaurant person.</font>

373
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,320
<font size="36">I'm a restaurant person.
Why wouldn't I be?</font>

374
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,200
<font size="36">Cheese string?</font>

375
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,720
<font size="36">No, thanks.
What's this place called?</font>

376
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,040
<font size="36">Mesijos.</font>

377
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,000
<font size="36">Is that French?</font>

378
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,920
<font size="36">French? No, it's English.</font>

379
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,920
<font size="36">OK, thank you, Moss,
I'll give that a go.</font>

380
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,920
<font size="36">I need a place to bring this girl
that says, "I'm a bastard!"</font>

381
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,120
<font size="36">I went to a good place recently.</font>

382
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,040
<font size="36">Nice atmosphere, food's great,
it's got a bit of an edge.</font>

383
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,240
<font size="36">Yeah? What's it called?</font>

384
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,400
<font size="36">Mesijos.</font>

385
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,600
<font size="36">What is that, Spanish?</font>

386
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,120
<font size="36">No! Spanish? It's English. Mesijos.</font>

387
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,640
<font size="36">Okey-dokey, you get the
firecracker nachos!</font>

388
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,480
<font size="36">And you get the
prawn bites with spicy salsa!</font>

389
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,120
<font size="36">This seems an unusual place for
someone like you to want to meet.</font>

390
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:00,760
<font size="36">Yeah, well, everyone needs
a place to come to be alone.</font>

391
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,280
<font size="36">Can we get a clown over here, please?</font>

392
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,080
<font size="36">You're a loner?</font>

393
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,600
<font size="36">I'm a loner, all right.</font>

394
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,800
<font size="36">I'm just...</font>

395

<font size="36">a lonely loner...</font>

396
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,080
<font size="36">on the lonely road.</font>

00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,520
<font size="36">Alone.</font>

398
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,200
<font size="36">Do you always wear shades?</font>

399
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,000
<font size="36">Always.</font>

400
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,200
<font size="36">They help me hide the fact...</font>

401
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,000
<font size="36">I'm always lying...</font>

<font size="36">If you're coming, can
you just bloody hurry up?</font>

441
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,680
<font size="36">I'm coming... I just need to
take my shoes off.</font>

442
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,360
<font size="36">They look like such fools.</font>

443
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,920
<font size="36">I'll call you a cab.</font>

444
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,760
<font size="36">No, no, no, it's fine.</font>

445
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,200
<font size="36">Taxi!</font>

446
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,040
<font size="36">I'll get the night bus.</font>

447
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,520
<font size="36">Don't be stupid, it's cold. Taxi!</font>

448
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,160
<font size="36">Here...</font>

449
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,280
<font size="36">Oh, God.</font>

450
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,480
<font size="36">You can have your 20 back. I don't
really think the bet proved anything.</font>

451
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,120
<font size="36">Taxi!</font>

452
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,960
<font size="36">Thanks, Roy.</font>

453
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,960
<font size="36">I just want...</font>

454
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,960
<font size="36">Night, then!</font>

455
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,840
<font size="36">Just a lonely loner,
walking down a lonely road.</font>

456
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,360
<font size="36">Hi, girls, my name's Maurice Moss,
or Moss for short.</font>

457
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,080
<font size="36">Sorry about the sound quality,
but I'm having to do this</font>

458
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,760
<font size="36">in the toilet of my mum's house.</font>

459
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,720
<font size="36">She's watching Diagnosis Murder
at full volume</font>

460
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,720
<font size="36">and it drives me up the wall.</font>

461
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,240
<font size="36">Don't worry, though, I'm sitting
on the toilet, but I'm not using it.</font>

462
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,080
<font size="36">KNOCK AT DOOR</font>

463
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,320
<font size="36">What?</font>

464
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,680
<font size="36">< Moss? What are you doing in there?</font>

465
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,320
<font size="36">Number twos, leave me alone.</font>

466
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,440
<font size="36">< Don't forget to flush the toilet.
Don't clog it up like you usually do.</font>

467
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,640
<font size="36">I know! Stop doing this,
you're always doing this!</font>

468
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,160
<font size="36">You're making it go back in!</font>

469
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,200
<font size="36">Now, my type...</font>
