00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:51,370
So, I'm still alive.

3
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,960
Huh?

7
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,090
An entry you don't recall?

8
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:31,990
Yeah.

9
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,760
I have absolutely no memory of it, 
but it was entered into my IP device.

10
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:54,460
<b>Fri.</b>

<b>Wed.</b>

17
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,020
I see. How strange.

18
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,190
That's in about two and a half hours.

19
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,460
Some Grandpa from a parallel world 
probably came and input it.

20
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:59,020
That might be it, actually.

21
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:05,320
That, or you've gone so senile that you forgot 
you put it in there yourself, Grandpa.

22
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,500
Ai!

23
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,840
I'd say that's the far 
more likely possibility.

24
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,410
So? Are you going?

25
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,230
That's a good question.

26
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,440
It does read like a promise, or something.

27
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,780
I don't think you should go, Grandpa.

28
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,350
Why?

29
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,870
'Cause you'll only realize 
you really have gone senile.

30
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,300
Ai, that's quite enough.

31
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:33,940
And the chilled chocolate 
is a treat you get at 3 PM.

32
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,890
I thought you were studying 
in your room until lunch?

33
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:44,160
Which is why I need some 
barley tea as a study buddy.

34
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:58,550
So, kids these days already know the term 
"parallel world" in elementary school.

35
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,700
Supposedly, they learn it 
in the early grades.

36
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,200
Eri-san mentioned it.

37
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,660
Is that so...

38
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,410
Why not go?

39
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,190
Aren't you curious?

40
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,670
If you go there, you might 
remember something.

41
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,420
That's true. And it's in the neighborhood.

42
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,700
I'll be back in a bit.

43
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,820
Yes, dear. Be careful.

44
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,100
Hold on.

45
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,880
Your hat. I'll go get it.

46
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,690
Oh, that one's fine.

47
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,190
This one?

48
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:05,470
<b>Please wait until the traffic signal changes.</b>

49
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:15,430
Tell me, dear. Why are you standing there?

50
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,540
It's dangerous.

51
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,040
You came for me?

52
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,620
Yeah. I'm here.

53
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,400
<i>The light is changing. 
Please exit the crosswalk.</i>

54
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,460
<i>Take care not to stop

55
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,660
<b>Please wait until the traffic signal changes.</b>

56
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,590
Did I Parallel Shift?

57
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,120
Display IEPP.

58
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,130
An error?

59
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,000
Where am I?

60
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:36,330
To Every You I've Loved Before

61
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:43,310
<i>From the moment they're born, 
people make countless choices.</i>

62
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:49,050
<i>The worlds with the option you 
didn't choose are alternate realities.</i>

63
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,350
<i>In other words, parallel worlds.</i>

64
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,260
<i>And their existence has now 
been demonstrated.</i>

65
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:00,830
<i>Moving into a parallel world 
is called Parallel Shifting.</i>

66
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,490
<i>That said, it's not your physical 
body that does the moving.</i>

67
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,440
<i>Your consciousness, termed 
your imaginality, trades places.</i>

68
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,760
<i>Small Parallel Shifts are 
an everyday occurrence,</i>

69
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,850
<i>but you basically never notice.</i>

70
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,160
<i>When you can't find something
 where you left it,</i>

71
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,230
<i>but then it's there when you double-check,</i>

72
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:26,120
<i>it's often because 
of a small Parallel Shift.</i>

73
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,730
<i>If we say your original world is "0",</i>

74
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:35,410
<i>you Shifted from world 0, where you left
 the item there, to world 1, where you didn't,</i>

75
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,270
<i>then Shifted back to 0.</i>

76
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,750
<i>The farther from 0 you go, the greater 
the difference in the tangible world.</i>

77
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,600
<i>You might have a different occupation tha
n you did in world 0, or a different spouse.</i>

78
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:55,190
<i>Still, they're all worlds 
that your choices can lead to.</i>

79
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:01,380
<i>The first time I made 
a major choice was when I was 7.</i>

80
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,660
Between Dad...

81
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,390
Or Mom...

82
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,900
<i>Who do you wanna go with?</i>

83
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,160
<i>I no longer remember where 
or how exactly they said it.</i>

84
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,910
<i>But that was essentially the situation.</i>

85
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,910
<i>I wonder how I felt, and what I said.</i>

86
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,120
<i>Even after my parents' divorce,</i>

87
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,920
<i>several times a month we'd 
all go on outings together.</i>

88
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,670
<i>But, once fun time was over,</i>

89
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:34,430
<i>we'd leave my dad, and I'd go with 
my mom back to her childhood home.</i>

90
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:38,150
<i>Her home was large but very old.</i>

91
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,910
<i>"It was already ancient when 
your old Grandpa was a kid."</i>

92
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:43,840
<i>Old enough for my grandpa to say that.</i>

93
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,420
<i>Despite there being no second 
floor, it had two entryways,</i>

94
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,320
<i>but it wasn't a two-family home.</i>

95
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:55,010
<i>The one in front is only ever opened 
during New Year and on special days.</i>

96
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,870
<i>Normally, we just use 
the smaller one in the back.</i>

97
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,150
<i>We lived there with my grandfather, 
my grandmother, and a big dog.</i>

98
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,370
<i>The pond in the inner yard 
didn't have fish or turtles,</i>

99
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,460
<i>and most of the rooms were empty.</i>

100
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:14,130
<i>The only things it had in excess 
were empty space and ceilings.</i>

101
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:34,480
Koyomi, where'd you get that?

102
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,820
Dad bought it for me last time I saw him.

103
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,080
It's my present for my eighth birthday!

104
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,900
Yuno.

105
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,320
Bang.

106
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,150
You're too young to have this.

107
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,270
It says for ages 10 and up.

108
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,990
Yeah...

109
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,730
But the other kids have them, too.

110
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,790
You don't need to copy bad stuff 
from the other kids.

111
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,280
Grandpa!

112
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,130
Koyomi, is something wrong?

113
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,550
I'm never talking to Grandpa again!

114
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,080
Mom.

115
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,130
Yes, dear?

116
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,360
Can I take Yuno for her walk?

117
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,590
Go ahead. But come back early so 
you can get ready for the wake.

118
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:34,950
Yuno?

119
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,320
Geez...

120
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,310
You can't just take off.

121
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,880
Hey! Yuno!

122
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,870
Stop, Yuno!

123
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,830
Wait! Wâ€”

124
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,570
Hey. Can you open this?

125
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,120
Open this lid.

126
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,370
Thanks.

127
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,350
Hey, wait a second!

128
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,930
<b>Imaginary Science Research Institute</b>

129
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,700
Imaginary Science...

130
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,740
This is where Dad works.

131
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,480
U-Um! Um, excuse me, ma'am?

132
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,480
Excuse me. Could I borrow your phone?

133
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:50,950
I was really surprised to get a call 
from you all of a sudden.

134
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:54,470
You could have just called your dad 
since you were at the Institute.

135
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:58,160
I don't have Dad's cell phone number, though.

136
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,210
You had mine?

137
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:04,010
I don't have it. I know it. 
I call it all the time.

138
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,970
What are you talking about? 
You're a goofball.

139
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,250
Koyomi, what are you doing?

140
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,410
Um, nothing. I'm coming.

141
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,830
I'm home. Koyomi's visiting.

142
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:28,900
Visiting?

143
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,240
Hey there, Koyomi.

144
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,620
Is Mom in the kitchen?

145
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,750
She is.

146
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:40,750
It's been a while. Tell me, how've you been?

147
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,740
<i>I'm in a different world.</i>

148
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,760
If I'd known I could've 
made something special!

149
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,770
Not that you ever need to call us first. 
This is your home, too, Koyomi.

150
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:53,130
<i>This is a world where 
I chose to go with my dad.</i>

151
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:56,610
<i>And it's a world where 
Grandpa's still alive.</i>

152
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,350
Right?

153
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,610
Right.

154
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,340
That's right. Come by any time.

155
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:04,190
Now then, I think 
I'll go give Yuno her supper.

156
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,280
I'll come with you.

157
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,830
You will?

158
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,540
Let's both go, then.

159
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:22,540
Yuno, Koyomi came to see us today.

160
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,330
Grandpa.

161
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,560
Ah, Koyomi.

162
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,960
What is it?

163
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,550
Can I sleep in your room with you tonight?

164
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:42,560
Yes, of course you can.

165
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,300
That reminds me.

166
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,940
Is this the first time you've 
visited since you turned eight?

167
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,070
So Yuno's gone.

168
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,010
Yeah.

169
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:08,090
There's no way we could 
make it so she's alive again?

170
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:14,380
Unfortunately, that's not possible. 
The dead can't come back to life.

171
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,710
Grandpa, I'm sorry.

172
00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:24,890
I never got to say sorry after our fight.

173
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,940
Our fight?

174
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:31,830
Did we have a fight 
the last time you came over?

175
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,710
Did your old Grandpa 
scold you for something?

176
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,020
Even when that happens, it doesn't 
mean Grandpa doesn't love you.

177
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,630
Don't worry.

178
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,560
Really? How come?

179
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,810
How do I explain it?

180
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:57,890
Would you rather be sad yourself, 
or for someone else to be sad?

181
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:02,530
Well, I mean... <i>I</i> don't wanna be sad.

182
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,680
Right. And everyone's like that.

183
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:10,490
So, because of a momentary mood
 or whatever other reasons,

184
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,600
people do things that make others sad.

185
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:17,560
Usually, they only realize 
their mistake later,

186
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,420
and wonder why they ever did those things.

187
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,340
But at that point, they can't fix it,

188
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:30,650
so they suffer the pain of that
 sadness over and over.

189
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,550
It's truly a difficult thing to go through.

190
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,110
So you see, your old Grandpa

191
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:44,870
is only trying to help you avoid that 
based on his own experiences.

192
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,760
Because Grandpa loves you.

193
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,320
Because you love me?

194
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,240
Yup, it sure is.

195
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,000
But y'know, your old Grandpa 
makes mistakes sometimes, too.

196
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:01,500
So in the end, what you do is
 for you to decide, Koyomi.

197
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:05,460
You're going to experience 
all sorts of things.

198
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:11,000
You might encounter situations where 
nobody knows what might happen.

199
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,180
That's just how plentiful 
the choices you have are.

200
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,680
Choices...

201
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:23,290
<i>Then my grandfather explained 
the significance of possibilities to me,</i>

202
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:26,730
<i>but at that age, I couldn't 
really wrap my head around it.</i>

203
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:32,980
It's even hard for your Grandpa 
to figure out a simple explanation.

204
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,660
You're bright, Koyomi,

205
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,740
so once you get it, make sure 
you can explain it clearly to others.

206
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,500
Okay.

207
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:45,760
Even when you mess up, your 
old Grandpa will never hate you.

208
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,010
So even when Grandpa occasionally 
makes a mistake of his own,

209
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:51,510
don't go hating him immediately, okay?

210
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,350
I love you, too, Grandpa.

211
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,370
Good morning.

212
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,360
Mom?

213
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,620
What is it?

214
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,910
Where's Grandpa?

215
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,340
The funeral people made 
him look really nice,

216
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,760
and now he's resting in the main hall.

217
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,310
Is something wrong?

218
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,820
Mom, yesterday I...

219
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,970
There's no reason to feel embarrassed.

220
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,880
This is a tough time.

221
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,050
It's perfectly normal to want some company.

222
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,980
Okay.

223
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,580
Now, let's get ready.

224
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:04,350
We've gotta give Grandpa a proper sendoff.

225
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:13,550
<i>The man in my grandfather's altar
 photo wore a stern expression,</i>

226
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:17,420
<i>and looked nothing like the same, 
mellow man from the previous night.</i>

227
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,930
<i>The thin-looking man in the coffin 
didn't look like the picture, either.</i>

228
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,570
I brought fresh water.

229
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:30,560
Thanks.

230
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,070
Put it down there.

231
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:37,680
Now, take a look in the top 
section of that tall cabinet.

232
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,690
Okay.

233
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,450
Be careful, honey.

234
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,680
Yes, Grandma.

235
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,790
Mom, look.

236
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:51,490
Oh my. I'm amazed he saved this.

237
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,330
What do we do with it?

238
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:55,460
Well, it's not like we need to 
completely empty this room out,

239
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,960
so let's put it back and...

240
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:01,970
<b></b>Happy 10th birthday, Koyomi.
 Don't point this at people or animals.
