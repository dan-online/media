152
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:25,500
<font size="36">IQ of 142, one of the cleverest blokes I know.</font>

153
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:26,667
<font size="36">Certainly the cleverest bloke you know, isn't he?</font>

154
00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:28,234
<font size="36">Chris Finch, yeah.</font>

155
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,267
<font size="36">He was in an argument once and he went,</font>

156
00:08:30,334 --> 00:08:32,734
<font size="36">"How can I hate women? My mum's one."</font>

157
00:08:36,367 --> 00:08:37,968
<font size="36">Yeah? There's a lot of truth in that.</font>

158
00:08:38,033 --> 00:08:42,300
<font size="36">And that's why when I see rubbish, all right?</font>

159
00:08:42,367 --> 00:08:45,167
<font size="36">I'm not annoyed 'cause I'm in it or I'm a prude.</font>

160
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:48,567
<font size="36">-It offends women. -And our mums.</font>

161
00:08:48,634 --> 00:08:52,601
<font size="36">In a way. It's sexist, and I hate that.</font>

162
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:54,801
<font size="36">-So do I. -Yeah, but I've said it, haven't I?</font>

163
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,667
<font size="36">We've both said it. We've had meetings where we've both said it.</font>

164
00:08:56,734 --> 00:08:59,767
<font size="36">-Yeah, but I really hate it. -I've always...</font>

165
00:09:00,868 --> 00:09:03,000
<font size="36">The point is this, yeah?</font>

166
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:06,234
<font size="36">We've got access to the internet, yeah? But it is not censored.</font>

167
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,534
<font size="36">Is that a good or a bad thing?</font>

168
00:09:07,601 --> 00:09:10,133
<font size="36">-Bad. -Well, it's not for us to say.</font>

171
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:19,300
<font size="36">It takes a little while.</font>

00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:23,400
<font size="36">2,230 matches. Yeah?</font>

173

<font size="36">Just click on one at random.</font>

174
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:28,100

176
00:09:30,734 --> 00:09:32,167
<font size="36">Now, you do not punish someone,</font>

177
00:09:32,234 --> 00:09:34,634
<font size="36">Dutch or otherwise, for having big boobs.</font>

178
00:09:34,701 --> 00:09:36,100
<font size="36">If anything, they should be rewarded.</font>

179
00:09:36,167 --> 00:09:37,934
<font size="36">-They should be equal. -Women are equal.</font>

180
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,934
<font size="36">I've always said that, so...</font>

181
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:44,100
<font size="36">-Do you want to play with my hair? -Huh?</font>

182
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:45,701
<font size="36">-Do you want to play with my hair. -Play with your hair?</font>

183
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:46,767
<font size="36">All right, then.</font>

184
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:53,133
<font size="36">I've got kind of hot hands. Sorry.</font>

185
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,067
<font size="36">That's all right. Just don't touch my head.</font>

186
00:09:57,968 --> 00:09:59,634
<font size="36">All it is...</font>

187
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:02,834
<font size="36">Well...</font>

00:10:15,767 --> 00:10:17,834
<font size="36">-Out of bounds. -Yeah.</font>

194

<font size="36">Yeah, whatever. Okay?</font>

208
00:10:53,968 --> 00:10:57,567
<font size="36">Okay. I will need some stuff.</font>

209
00:10:57,634 --> 00:10:58,968
<font size="36">Like what?</font>

210
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,767
<font size="36">An office.</font>

211
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:02,601
<font size="36">Well, use the meeting room for now.</font>

212
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:04,901
<font size="36">Right. I can say it's my office, can I?</font>

213
00:11:04,968 --> 00:11:06,367
<font size="36">What?</font>

214
00:11:06,434 --> 00:11:08,801
<font size="36">I can say to people, "Come into my office"?</font>

304
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:15,968

315
00:15:41,801 --> 00:15:44,734
<font size="36">I gave a speech only this morning to my staff,</font>

320
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,934

321
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,901

328
00:16:20,467 --> 00:16:21,767

00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:23,868

00:16:36,033 --> 00:16:38,734

<font size="36">Well, you backed me into a corner and I...</font>

440
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,834
<font size="36">-You lied. -It's a form of acting.</font>

441
00:21:44,901 --> 00:21:46,767
<font size="36">Can you take this upstairs? We're a bit busy.</font>

442
00:21:46,834 --> 00:21:49,534
<font size="36">-You don't look busy. -Do you want me to get busy, love?</font>

443
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:51,000
<font size="36">I'm sorry?</font>

444
00:21:51,067 --> 00:21:52,934
<font size="36">You can be next. Gazza likes some posh.</font>

445
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,133
<font size="36">-A word with you. Now. -Yep.</font>

446
00:21:57,033 --> 00:21:58,234
<font size="36">That was out of order in a way.</font>

447
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,167
<font size="36">-Ooh! -No, I'm not in trouble.</font>

448
00:22:00,234 --> 00:22:02,400
<font size="36">What she needs is a good shagging!</font>

449
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:05,667
<font size="36">I might bloody have to now. See you later.</font>

450
00:22:07,167 --> 00:22:09,901
<font size="36">Now, then. You two.</font>

451
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,100
<font size="36">Dawn and Tim.</font>

452
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:15,400
<font size="36">What do you want, Gareth?</font>

453
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:18,834
<font size="36">I've been assigned to find out who did the picture.</font>

454
00:22:18,901 --> 00:22:20,267
<font size="36">Right. Who was it?</font>

455
00:22:20,334 --> 00:22:22,400
<font size="36">-Well, I don't know. -Will you get fired?</font>

456
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:23,934
<font size="36">-Will I get fired? -If you don't know who did it.</font>

457
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,667
<font size="36">Well, I'm finding out now. I'm doing investigations now.</font>

458
00:22:26,734 --> 00:22:29,567
<font size="36">-Was it one of you two? -Yes. Christ, you're good.</font>

459
00:22:29,634 --> 00:22:31,033
<font size="36">-Was it? -No!</font>

460
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,734
<font size="36">I knew it wasn't.</font>

461
00:22:32,801 --> 00:22:35,000
<font size="36">Listen. I'm not going to fire you if you know anything</font>

462
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:36,500
<font size="36">-because... -You couldn't.</font>

463
00:22:36,567 --> 00:22:37,968
<font size="36">-I could. -How would that work?</font>

464
00:22:38,033 --> 00:22:40,467
<font size="36">I would say, "You're fired. Clear your desk and..."</font>

465
00:22:40,534 --> 00:22:41,934
<font size="36">I would say, "You don't have the authority." But go on.</font>

466
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,367
<font size="36">Not true, not true.</font>

467
00:22:43,434 --> 00:22:45,934
<font size="36">Because in this room, I have special...</font>

468
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,133
<font size="36">-Needs? -No. I am a special...</font>

469
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,167
<font size="36">-Needs child? -No, and that's not funny. All right?</font>

470
00:22:51,234 --> 00:22:53,367
<font size="36">-I won't have you fired because... -You couldn't.</font>

471
00:22:53,434 --> 00:22:54,667
<font size="36">-Right, that's all. -Thank you.</font>

472
00:23:04,901 --> 00:23:07,067
<font size="36">I just can't believe their total lack of respect.</font>

473
00:23:07,133 --> 00:23:10,467
<font size="36">Yeah, yeah. Not only did they undermine you in an authoritive sense...</font>

474
00:23:10,534 --> 00:23:12,467
<font size="36">-(KNOCKING) -Come in, Gareth.</font>

475
00:23:12,534 --> 00:23:14,701
<font size="36">...but they left an image in my mind</font>

476
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:17,300
<font size="36">of you naked on all fours</font>

477
00:23:17,367 --> 00:23:20,467
<font size="36">being quite literally done doggie-style.</font>

478
00:23:20,534 --> 00:23:22,634
<font size="36">David!</font>

479
00:23:24,033 --> 00:23:26,200
<font size="36">-Carry on. -What is it?</font>

480
00:23:26,267 --> 00:23:27,901
<font size="36">I've found the guilty man.</font>

481
00:23:27,968 --> 00:23:30,701
<font size="36">-Have you indeed, Mr Keenan? -Can this wait, David?</font>

482
00:23:30,767 --> 00:23:32,934
<font size="36">Uh, yeah,</font>

483
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,734
<font size="36">but if I tell you there's pornography, sexist pornography, which I hate,</font>

484
00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:37,834
<font size="36">going round the office, then do you want it to wait?</font>

485
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:39,500
<font size="36">Pornography?</font>

486
00:23:39,567 --> 00:23:43,200
<font size="36">-Who was it? -Surprise, surprise. It was Tim.</font>

487
00:23:43,267 --> 00:23:45,367
<font size="36">Shame. Good man. How can you be sure?</font>

488
00:23:45,434 --> 00:23:48,767
<font size="36">I found these pictures on his hard drive downloaded from the internet.</font>

489
00:23:48,834 --> 00:23:50,133
<font size="36">After investigation,</font>

490
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,767
<font size="36">licensed by, carried out by...</font>

491
00:23:54,534 --> 00:23:56,767
<font size="36">Oh, no.</font>

492
00:23:56,834 --> 00:24:00,434
<font size="36">Urgh. I don't want you to see this. I don't want to see this. Urgh.</font>

493
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,033
<font size="36">That's worse than the one before.</font>

494
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,400
<font size="36">Oh, I hope there aren't any more. There are more.</font>

495
00:24:06,467 --> 00:24:08,934
<font size="36">Well, he will have to be disciplined</font>

496
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,901
<font size="36">because when the disciplining has to be done,</font>

497
00:24:11,968 --> 00:24:15,167
<font size="36">then the laughter stops for that amount of time, then continues,</font>

498
00:24:15,234 --> 00:24:17,801
<font size="36">rehabilitation notwithstanding.</font>

499
00:24:17,868 --> 00:24:20,100
<font size="36">It's everywhere. Oh.</font>

500
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,934
<font size="36">How did you find out?</font>

501
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,200
<font size="36">Well, I suspected the pictures probably came off the internet,</font>

502
00:24:24,267 --> 00:24:25,901
<font size="36">so I checked everyone's computer.</font>

503
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,033
<font size="36">'Cause there is a log of every web page you've visited.</font>

504
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,767
<font size="36">You just go to Internet Page and then Net History.</font>

505
00:24:31,834 --> 00:24:35,133
<font size="36">-Well, it's not worth it... -It only takes a second.</font>

506
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,701
<font size="36">I don't want to even know how it's done, in a way.</font>

507
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:41,667
<font size="36">Can you delete the history thing on the computer? We should, really.</font>

508
00:24:41,734 --> 00:24:44,467
<font size="36">-David, this is a meeting. -Yeah, yeah.</font>

509
00:24:44,534 --> 00:24:47,334
<font size="36">Okay. That's all. Anything else?</font>

510
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,167
<font size="36">Um, oh, Taffy phoned from the warehouse.</font>

511
00:24:49,234 --> 00:24:50,934
<font size="36">-He's got another funny video for you. -Thanks.</font>

512
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,300
<font size="36">-This is just one big boys' club! -Not really.</font>

513
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:56,000
<font size="36">Seedy little men with seedy little jokes.</font>

514
00:24:56,067 --> 00:24:57,801
<font size="36">This morning, perfect example!</font>

515
00:24:57,868 --> 00:24:59,901
<font size="36">I do not want to be put in that position again.</font>

516
00:24:59,968 --> 00:25:02,033
<font size="36">Don't go down the warehouse.</font>

517
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,500
<font size="36">David, don't tell me where I can and can't go in my own company.</font>

518
00:25:04,567 --> 00:25:05,868
<font size="36">-Advice... -You're on very thin ice as it is.</font>

519
00:25:05,934 --> 00:25:09,133
<font size="36">You've already lied to me today. What's that?</font>

520
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,000
<font size="36">You lied to me because you don't have the guts to do your own job.</font>

521
00:25:12,067 --> 00:25:13,601
<font size="36">I don't have the guts?</font>

522
00:25:13,667 --> 00:25:17,767
<font size="36">If you're not man enough to do your job, I will do it for you.</font>

523
00:25:17,834 --> 00:25:19,400
<font size="36">Not man enough?</font>

524
00:25:20,534 --> 00:25:22,534
<font size="36">Okay.</font>

525
00:25:22,601 --> 00:25:24,167
<font size="36">Come here.</font>

526
00:25:32,267 --> 00:25:34,567
<font size="36">Busy at work?</font>

527
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:37,601
<font size="36">-Is there a problem? -Yeah. That.</font>

528
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:39,968
<font size="36">-I'm sorry. What's that? -(CHUCKLES) "What's that?"</font>

529
00:25:40,033 --> 00:25:44,500
<font size="36">I don't know. A dirty picture with my head on it, as a sex object.</font>

530
00:25:44,567 --> 00:25:48,868
<font size="36">And don't... You know I like a laugh, Tim. I'm just...</font>

531
00:25:48,934 --> 00:25:52,367
<font size="36">Porno laughs are not funny, okay?</font>

532
00:25:52,434 --> 00:25:55,000
<font size="36">-I'm disappointed. -You think I did this?</font>

533
00:25:55,067 --> 00:25:57,000
<font size="36">Case closed.</font>

534
00:25:57,067 --> 00:25:59,534
<font size="36">Hey, shouldn't I say that? As it was my investigation.</font>

535
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:02,934
<font size="36">What annoys me is you obviously didn't do it in your own time...</font>

536
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,934
<font size="36">Whoa, whoa. Colombo here figured it out, did he?</font>

537
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,567
<font size="36">Well, yeah, of... I must be guilty if you've got your best man on the case!</font>

538
00:26:10,634 --> 00:26:13,234
<font size="36">Stop trying to be funny for one second, Tim, okay?</font>

539
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,067
<font size="36">And listen, okay? And stop taking advantage of my good nature</font>

540
00:26:16,133 --> 00:26:19,234
<font size="36">'cause I could be like every other boss in this situation.</font>

541
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,667
<font size="36">Okay? Right?</font>

542
00:26:20,734 --> 00:26:24,067
<font size="36">You're taking the piss and I'm getting sick of it.</font>

543
00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:27,567
<font size="36">David, it wasn't me, okay? It was your good friend Chris Finch.</font>

544
00:26:29,801 --> 00:26:31,300
<font size="36">He used my computer.</font>

545
00:26:31,367 --> 00:26:34,000
<font size="36">He said he was your best mate and you'd find it hilarious.</font>

546
00:26:34,067 --> 00:26:36,200
<font size="36">Oh...</font>

547
00:26:36,267 --> 00:26:39,400
<font size="36">No, it is. That was never in question.</font>

548
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:43,033
<font size="36">I think it's bloody hilarious. You're missing the...</font>

549
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,868
<font size="36">Are you going to apologise to Tim?</font>

550
00:26:45,934 --> 00:26:49,601
<font size="36">I'll tell you about families. You don't have to, in a way.</font>

551
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:51,033
<font size="36">So...</font>

552
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,334
<font size="36">Are you going to apologise to Tim?</font>

553
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,167
<font size="36">I have, in a way...</font>

554
00:26:55,234 --> 00:26:58,400
<font size="36">-Are you going to apologise now? -Yes!</font>

555
00:27:04,868 --> 00:27:08,601
<font size="36">S... sorry about that.</font>

556
00:27:08,667 --> 00:27:10,801
<font size="36">You weren't involved... You covered for it so well, as well.</font>

557
00:27:10,868 --> 00:27:12,734
<font size="36">You were involved, but you covered, that's what I like.</font>

558
00:27:12,801 --> 00:27:14,534
<font size="36">Well, I really wouldn't want to be here when you bawl out Finchy.</font>

559
00:27:14,601 --> 00:27:16,634
<font size="36">You won't be. It's not fair. Nor will you.</font>

560
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:19,601
<font size="36">So it's not offensive now it's Chris Finch?</font>

561

<font size="36">Let's not dwell on whether it is or isn't this or...</font>

566
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,500

567
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:39,167
<font size="36">Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll get rid of a good rep</font>

568
00:27:39,234 --> 00:27:40,968
