00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:39,360
<font size="36"># We don't need no education... #</font>

3
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,000
<font size="36">Yes, you do.
You've just used a double negative.</font>

4
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,240
<font size="36">Notice anything?</font>

5
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,280
<font size="36">What? Guess.</font>

6
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,360
<font size="36">Something wrong with your eyes.</font>

7
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:58,720
<font size="36">No, I have a new cup.
What's wrong with my eyes?</font>

8
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,520
<font size="36">It's not very distinctive. How's
anyone supposed to know it's yours?</font>

9
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,680
<font size="36">There's a picture of me on it.</font>

10
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,120
<font size="36">No, there isn't!</font>

11
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,360
<font size="36">Yes, there is.</font>

12
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,080
<font size="36">No, there isn't, Moss.</font>

13
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,040
<font size="36">Yes, there is. I am sick of
my things going walkabout.</font>

14
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,400
<font size="36">With this picture, everyone knows
that a certain Mr Moss</font>

15
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,520
<font size="36">might be looking for his cup...</font>

16
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,840
<font size="36">There is nothing on the cup!</font>

17
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,080
<font size="36">Wrangle with him and you'll
find your hand full, my friend.</font>

18
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,520
<font size="36">Wrangle with who?!
There's no-one there!</font>

19
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,120
<font size="36">Morning.</font>

20
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,680
<font size="36">Morning.</font>

21
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,640
<font size="36">D'you have a nice weekend?</font>

22
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,840
<font size="36">It was all right, thanks.</font>

23
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,040
<font size="36">Not you.</font>

24
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,000
<font size="36">I did too.</font>

25
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,640
<font size="36">< Nice scarf.</font>

26
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,520
<font size="36">I'm not wearing a scarf.</font>

27
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,840
<font size="36">Not you, Moss!</font>

28
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,800
<font size="36">Notice anything new about Moss?</font>

29
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,080
<font size="36">His eyes?</font>

30
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,400
<font size="36">What is wrong with my eyes?!</font>

31
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,320
<font size="36">No, he has a new cup.
It's the talk of the office!</font>

32
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,880
<font size="36">Yes, I think I read about it
in Heat.</font>

33
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,680
<font size="36">Receptionist, third floor,
Gloria what's-her-name,</font>

34
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,600
<font size="36">have you seen her baby?</font>

35
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,840
<font size="36">I didn't even know she was pregnant.</font>

36
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,520
<font size="36">She was out to here.</font>

37
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,960
<font size="36">Yeah, I thought she was
stealing office equipment.</font>

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,360
<font size="36">That's how I got that monitor home.</font>

39
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,480
<font size="36">Do you want to sit here?</font>

40
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,600
<font size="36">What?</font>

41
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,120
<font size="36">Ask me where it is.</font>

42
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,400
<font size="36">Where was it?</font>

43
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,800
<font size="36">The picture.</font>

44
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,800
<font size="36">Where's the picture, Moss?</font>

45
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,400
<font size="36">It's on the base, Roy.</font>

46
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,960
<font size="36">OK, well, let's see it, then.</font>

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,800
<font size="36">Sure. I pour hot squash over myself
and we all have a good chuckle.</font>

48
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,800
<font size="36">Everyone except muggins here.</font>

49
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,040
<font size="36">I'll show you in a minute.</font>

50
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,440
<font size="36">Can I ask you two a question?</font>

51
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,520
<font size="36">Please, Christ, yes.</font>

52
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,040
<font size="36">Wait, one moment.</font>

53
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,880
<font size="36">OK, go.</font>

54
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,560
<font size="36">How can you two live like this?</font>

55
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,040
<font size="36">How can you two...?</font>

56
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,000
<font size="36">Don't Google the question, Moss!</font>

57
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,800
<font size="36">What are you talking about?</font>

58
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,720
<font size="36">It's so disgusting in here.</font>

59
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,040
<font size="36">I know nobody comes down here,
but it doesn't mean
you have to live like animals.</font>

60
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,920
<font size="36">You can clean that window
and you'd have a bit of light.</font>

61
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,040
<font size="36">What window?</font>

62
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,320
<font size="36">That one up there.</font>

63
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,920
<font size="36">Yeah, that's not a window.</font>

64
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,920
<font size="36">Yes, it is. Get it clean,
you'll have some light in here.</font>

65
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,840
<font size="36">I think that we have plenty of light.</font>

66
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,280
<font size="36">I think that's fine!</font>

67
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,840
<font size="36">Look at that CD tray.</font>

68
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,280
<font size="36">Isn't that important?</font>

69
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,520
<font size="36">Wouldn't you like to actually
put CDs in there at some point?</font>

70
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,120
<font size="36">Yes, ideally, but
I haven't the heart to move them.</font>

71
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,000
<font size="36">How did that even happen?</font>

72
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,520
<font size="36">OK, now I'm curious.</font>

73
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,800
<font size="36">Give us a look at the picture, then.</font>

74
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,520
<font size="36">What picture?</font>

75
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,160
<font size="36">The picture on the cup!</font>

76
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,200
<font size="36">Right.</font>

77
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,440
<font size="36">Behold!</font>

78
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,160
<font size="36">There's nothing there!</font>

79
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,960
<font size="36">What?!</font>

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,080
<font size="36">This isn't my cup!</font>

81
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,880
<font size="36">What is that?</font>

82
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,840
<font size="36">Goat's cheese salad.</font>

83
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,480
<font size="36">Ugh!</font>

84
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,760
<font size="36">You don't like goat's cheese?</font>

85
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,320
<font size="36">I don't like goat's anything!</font>

86
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,080
<font size="36">I don't like goats
being involved in</font>

87
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,040
<font size="36">any stage of
the food-production process.</font>

88
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,840
<font size="36">Would I blow everyone's mind
if I ate dessert first?</font>

89
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,480
<font size="36">What are you eating, anyway?</font>

90
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,520
<font size="36">It's a bucket of fried chicken.</font>

91
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,800
<font size="36">It comes in a real bucket now.</font>

92
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,760
<font size="36">Tell me,
what's behind that red door?</font>

93
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,640
<font size="36">CRASH</font>

94
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,760
<font size="36">BOTH: Nothing.</font>

95
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,600
<font size="36">There must be something behind it.</font>

96
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,320
<font size="36">There's nothing behind
the red door, Jen.</font>

97
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,880
<font size="36">Well then, I can just...</font>

98
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,560
<font size="36">No, Jen, it's just a boring
old store room, that's all!</font>

99
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,680
<font size="36">It's just a store room
where we keep the snibbits.</font>

100
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,800
<font size="36">What's a snibbit?</font>

101
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,480
<font size="36">It's a kind of plange.</font>

102
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,800
<font size="36">Oh, a plange for the computers?</font>

103
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,440
<font size="36">Yes, computer plange!</font>

104
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,120
<font size="36">If it's a store room, we can store
some of this stuff in...</font>

105
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,200
<font size="36">No, Jen! Look, I know that
you want to make your mark down here,</font>

106
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,560
<font size="36">and that's really sweet,
but you can't</font>

107
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,480
<font size="36">just go messing around with
the snibbit store room willy-nilly!</font>

108
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,840
<font size="36">You can't upset the whole
harmony of the place!</font>

109
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,800
<font size="36">Harmony?! What harmony?!</font>

110
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,800
<font size="36">I know that the place looks like
a bit of a mess,</font>

111
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,080
<font size="36">but it's actually
a very delicate ecosystem.</font>

112
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,480
<font size="36">Everything is connected.</font>

113
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,120
<font size="36">It's like the rainforest.</font>

114
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,720
<font size="36">You change one thing,
even the tiniest bit</font>

115
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,760
<font size="36">and the whole rainforest dies!</font>

116
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,160
<font size="36">You don't want
the rainforest to die, do you?!</font>

117
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,720
<font size="36">No, I really don't want
the rainforest to die.</font>

118
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,760
<font size="36">That's what will happen
if you open the red door.</font>

119
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,200
<font size="36">PHONE</font>

120
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,960
<font size="36">Hello, IT. Have you tried
turning it off and on again?</font>

121
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,720
<font size="36">OK, are you sure
that it's plugged in?!</font>

122
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,560
<font size="36">OK, I'll be up in a minute.</font>

123
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,080
<font size="36">What was that about?</font>

124
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,120
<font size="36">Girl on fourth.</font>

125
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,120
<font size="36">Ooh, job. You gonna go?</font>

126
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,280
<font size="36">Yeah, in a while. It can wait.</font>

127
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,520
<font size="36">Why can it wait? She probably needs
to get on, she needs a computer.</font>

128
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,520
<font size="36">I am reading a comic.</font>

129
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,440
<font size="36">I knew it. Every time
I used to phone IT in my last job,</font>

130
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,640
<font size="36">it'd take a good couple
of hours before someone got to me.</font>

131
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,760
<font size="36">That is how we do it.
You can't go off straightaway</font>

132
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,960
<font size="36">or they'll all expect it.
You're killing the rainforest!</font>

133
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,560
<font size="36">Stop saying that!</font>

134
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,600
<font size="36">It's more than that. Me and this
girl, I asked her out, she said no,</font>

135
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,000
<font size="36">it all got a little bit embarrassing
and ever since then, when I go up,</font>

136
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,080
<font size="36">she treats me like I'm some sort of
sexually frustrated cretin!</font>

137
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,360
<font size="36">Get up there now, please.</font>

138
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,560
<font size="36">You are not the head
of this department!</font>

139
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,520
<font size="36">No, I'm relationship manager.</font>

140
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,520
<font size="36">I'm the one who gets the complaints.
I'm the one whose name is on the...!</font>

141
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,120
<font size="36">Oh God, all right, I will
go up just to shut you up.</font>

142
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,760
<font size="36">(MOUTHS)</font>

143
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,200
<font size="36">God's sake!</font>

144
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,640
<font size="36">There's someone under here.</font>

145
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,920
<font size="36">Yes!</font>

146
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,960
<font size="36">Hello?</font>

147
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,600
<font size="36">Hello? Hello?</font>

148
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,040
<font size="36">You should get it fixed. ></font>

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,520
<font size="36">Oh, there's a builder outside
taking off his shirt.</font>

294
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,320
<font size="36">Like in ads?</font>

295
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,760
<font size="36">Yeah, like in ads.</font>

296
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,600
<font size="36">Everything all right downstairs?</font>

297
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,520
<font size="36">Yes, fine, I left
Moss and Richmond in charge.</font>

298
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,040
<font size="36">Good, well...
Richmond, out of his room?</font>

299
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,080
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

300
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,320
<font size="36">What did I say about the red door?
I said don't open the red door!</font>

00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,240

304
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,400
<font size="36">The people who turned their backs
on him as soon as he became a Goth.</font>

305
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,800
<font size="36">He obviously hasn't told
you about the funeral. Mm.</font>

306
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,040
<font size="36">Ask him about the funeral.</font>

313
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,880
<font size="36">Yes. Just to say,</font>

314
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,640
<font size="36">I met Richmond.</font>

315
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,600
<font size="36">I see.</font>

316
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,400
<font size="36">It isn't like for me to say,</font>

317
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,920
<font size="36">but it sounds like you two had
a good relationship at one point.</font>

318
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,360
<font size="36">You should speak to him.</font>

319

<font size="36">I'll thank you to
keep out of this, Jen.</font>

<font size="36">Goths are people, too.</font>

321
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,880
<font size="36">Enough.</font>

322
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,720
<font size="36">There's absolutely
no point to anything.</font>

323
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,440

No point, it's all futile.</font>

324

<font size="36">I can't even find my cup.</font>

325
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,440
<font size="36">You try to look on the bright side.</font>

326
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,600
<font size="36">Ha. The bright side.</font>

327
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,880
<font size="36">Sometimes you think, "What would
change if I just killed myself?"</font>

328
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,400
<font size="36">You're right.</font>

329
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,840
<font size="36">I could just kill myself.</font>

330
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,880
<font size="36">It'd be so easy, wouldn't it?</font>

331
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,880
<font size="36">So very, very easy.</font>

332
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,880
<font size="36">Richmond! Get back to your room.</font>

333
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,560
<font size="36">What's the point of sending him
back? What's the point of anything?</font>

334
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,480
<font size="36">Quick, get the brush.</font>

335
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,120
<font size="36">But she said I could come out.</font>

336
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,680
<font size="36">You're bringing everyone down.</font>

337
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,720
<font size="36">No, I'm not.</font>

338
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,000
<font size="36">Yes, he is.</font>

339
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,040
<font size="36">Come on.</font>

340
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,040
<font size="36">Thank you.</font>

341
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,360
<font size="36">Tell her why they sent you down
here. Tell her what you did.</font>

342
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,000
<font size="36">I don't know why I'm down here.</font>

343
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,960
<font size="36">So Denholm just demoted
you for nothing, did he?</font>

344
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,320
<font size="36">No, he changed,
after his father died.</font>

345
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,400
<font size="36">I don't think he ever
fully recovered.</font>

346
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,640
<font size="36">From the moment
I saw him at the funeral</font>

347
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,520
<font size="36">I could tell there
was something different.</font>

348
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,640
<font size="36">Bloody good of you to come, thanks.</font>

349
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,320
<font size="36">Thanks. Bloody good service,
wasn't it?</font>

350
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,680
<font size="36">Thank you very much.</font>

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,080

<font size="36">That was Denholm.</font>

361
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,080
<font size="36">He wants to see you.</font>

362
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,800
<font size="36">What is it?</font>

363
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,320
<font size="36">I can't believe you want me back.</font>

364
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,240
<font size="36">You've got Jen to thank.</font>

365
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,080
<font size="36">Her words the other day moved
me deeply, very deeply indeed.</font>

366
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,160
<font size="36">Really, what did she say?</font>

367
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,080
<font size="36">I can't remember.</font>

368
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,080
<font size="36">Point is, it's the effect of
the words that are important.</font>

369
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,320
<font size="36">Treating someone differently cos
of ther skin colour is wrong.</font>

370
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,640
<font size="36">I don't see why things can't
get back to the way they were.</font>

371
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,200
<font size="36">I don't know what to say.</font>

372
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,280
<font size="36">You're back with the
big guys, Richmond.</font>

373
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,320
<font size="36">Great.</font>

374
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,760
<font size="36">But that's if you're
prepared to take me on.</font>

375
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,520
<font size="36">You know how demanding I am.</font>

376
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,320
<font size="36">Stop it.</font>

377
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,720
<font size="36">You know how changeable I can be.</font>

378
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,040
<font size="36">Yes, Mr M.</font>

379
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,440
<font size="36">Call me Denholm.</font>

380
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,920
<font size="36">All right, thanks, Denholm.</font>

381
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,240
<font size="36">Oh no, I don't like that,
don't do it again.</font>

382
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,280
<font size="36">All right, sorry.</font>

383
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,080
<font size="36">In fact I've changed my
mind about the whole thing.</font>

384
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,120
<font size="36">What, you mean I have
to stay down here?</font>

385
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,520
<font size="36">Yes, leave me alone, you goblin.</font>

386
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,600
<font size="36">I suppose it isn't quite so bad now
I don't have to stay in that room.</font>

387
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,000
<font size="36">Yes, yes, we're happy to have you.</font>

388
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,600
<font size="36">Oh!</font>

389
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,400
<font size="36">My milky lens has popped out.</font>

390
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,360
<font size="36">Don't step on it.
You've got to help me find it.</font>

391
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,800
<font size="36">Oh, actually, I think it's
just popped round the back.</font>

392
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,160
<font size="36">It does that sometimes.</font>

393
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,400
<font size="36">Come on. Come on.</font>

394
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,920
<font size="36">Come on.</font>

395
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,680
<font size="36">Go on.</font>

396
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,240
<font size="36">It's almost ...</font>

397
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,120
<font size="36">How about that, then?</font>

398
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,560
<font size="36">That looks great.</font>

399
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,960
<font size="36">Told you it was a window.</font>

400
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,320
<font size="36">Bloody lens.</font>

401
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,440

402
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,240

403
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,560
<font size="36">Oh! I really ought to...</font>

405

<font size="36">Thank God.</font>

406
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,200
<font size="36">At least everything
is back to normal.</font>

goes through that door.</font>
