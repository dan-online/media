1
00:00:17,403 --> 00:00:18,923
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

2
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:32,483
Hello, welcome to Top Gear

3
00:00:32,483 --> 00:00:36,803
where tonight it's time to slip on
the old Lederhosen,

4
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:38,003
grab a Bratwurst

5
00:00:38,003 --> 00:00:40,563
and wrap it in a pain au chocolat.

6
00:00:40,563 --> 00:00:43,763
Because tonight we're off to France
and Germany.

7
00:00:43,763 --> 00:00:46,243
You are like a Pound Shop,
Michael Palin.

8
00:00:46,243 --> 00:00:47,643
I'm a man of culture.

9
00:00:47,643 --> 00:00:49,003
Fred, what are we starting with?

10
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:50,763
Supercars,
because here's the thing.

11
00:00:50,763 --> 00:00:52,563
Every time we talk about supercars,

12
00:00:52,563 --> 00:00:54,283
it's always those big numbers -

13
00:00:54,283 --> 00:00:56,203
power, speed, price.

14
00:00:56,203 --> 00:01:00,203
Yes, but we got to thinking, surely
the real point in supercars

15
00:01:00,203 --> 00:01:01,723
is how they make you feel,

16
00:01:01,723 --> 00:01:05,123
giving the lucky so-and-so behind
the wheel the time of the life.

17
00:01:05,123 --> 00:01:08,163
And for that does bigger,
really mean better?

18
00:01:08,163 --> 00:01:10,203
So to find out, we pick three cars

19
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,443
from different points
on the Supercar scale

20
00:01:12,443 --> 00:01:16,043
and set out to do some proper
testing in Germany.

21
00:01:25,443 --> 00:01:28,803
To find out if bigger really does
mean better

22
00:01:28,803 --> 00:01:30,603
in the world of supercars,

23
00:01:30,603 --> 00:01:33,323
the only way to kick off

24
00:01:33,323 --> 00:01:35,723
is with a treat from the very top

25
00:01:35,723 --> 00:01:38,923
of the supercar tree.

26
00:02:01,563 --> 00:02:05,843
The Pagani Huayra Roadster BC.

27
00:02:06,803 --> 00:02:08,523
I've gone grande,

28
00:02:08,523 --> 00:02:11,523
I've gone very grande.

29
00:02:11,523 --> 00:02:13,443
Whoa!

30
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:20,883
What we've got here is a
790-horsepower

31
00:02:20,883 --> 00:02:23,283
convertible hypercar

32
00:02:23,283 --> 00:02:28,643
that costs £3.2 million.

33
00:02:31,963 --> 00:02:34,923
But what does £3.2 million get you?

34
00:02:34,923 --> 00:02:38,683
Well, the body made of carbotanium,

35
00:02:38,683 --> 00:02:42,563
which is a mixture
of carbon fibre and titanium.

36
00:02:44,523 --> 00:02:46,443
And with fighter jet spec aero,

37
00:02:46,443 --> 00:02:50,803
with a bespoke six-litre-twin-turbo
AMGV 12...

38
00:02:52,003 --> 00:02:54,603
..it'll hit 60 in 3.2 seconds

39
00:02:54,603 --> 00:02:59,603
and top out at about 230mph.

40
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:03,323
Sure, the Huayra badge might be ten
years old now,

41
00:03:03,323 --> 00:03:08,643
but this latest roadster is still
utterly captivating.

42
00:03:11,163 --> 00:03:15,803
This thing is an absolute joy.

43
00:03:15,803 --> 00:03:17,203
HE LAUGHS

44
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:21,323
Unadulterated bliss.

45
00:03:27,363 --> 00:03:29,123
The question is, though,

46
00:03:29,123 --> 00:03:31,563
do you really need all that

47
00:03:31,563 --> 00:03:35,243
when you could save
yourself nearly three million quid

48
00:03:35,243 --> 00:03:38,323
and still have one of these?

49
00:03:45,843 --> 00:03:48,323
The 296 GTB,

50
00:03:48,323 --> 00:03:52,323
the latest, greatest
mid-engine supercar

51
00:03:52,323 --> 00:03:54,683
from the guys who've been making
supercars

52
00:03:54,683 --> 00:03:58,083
longer and better than anyone else.

53
00:04:02,683 --> 00:04:06,843
A new Ferrari supercar is always
a big deal...

54
00:04:08,283 --> 00:04:12,963
..but the big news with the 296 is
it's pointing the old prancing horse

55
00:04:12,963 --> 00:04:15,963
towards new, greener pastures.

56
00:04:15,963 --> 00:04:18,403
Instead of the traditional V8,

57
00:04:18,403 --> 00:04:21,083
this one's packing a smaller,
cleaner

58
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,643
plug-in hybrid V6.

59
00:04:26,323 --> 00:04:29,643
Now, if all that feels a bit
responsible and downsizey

60
00:04:29,643 --> 00:04:31,283
do not worry.

61
00:04:31,283 --> 00:04:36,443
This little, sensible Ferrari
produces 818 horsepower,

62
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,723
all to the rear wheels.

63
00:04:38,723 --> 00:04:42,243
Nought to 60 under three seconds.

64
00:04:42,243 --> 00:04:45,403
Top speed, 205 mile an hour.

65
00:04:45,403 --> 00:04:49,043
And this is Ferrari's
entry-level supercar.

66
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:53,083
The world has gone officially mad.

67
00:04:54,443 --> 00:04:56,643
Oh, jeez, jeez.

68
00:04:58,843 --> 00:05:00,123
Ah!

69
00:05:01,323 --> 00:05:03,283
How are you, my friend?

70
00:05:03,283 --> 00:05:05,763
I'm good, I'm just taking an eyeful

71
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,643
through my rear-view mirror,

72
00:05:07,643 --> 00:05:09,643
Pagani Huayra.

73
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,323
How much power has it got?

74
00:05:12,323 --> 00:05:14,643
Just under 800 brakehorse.

75
00:05:14,643 --> 00:05:18,603
So your car cost ten times
more than mine.

76
00:05:18,603 --> 00:05:21,003
And I've got over 800.

77
00:05:21,003 --> 00:05:23,843
It's not always about numbers
and facts and figures, is it?

78
00:05:23,843 --> 00:05:25,843
It's about the excitement, the joy.

79
00:05:26,803 --> 00:05:30,323
I hope you've got comprehensive
insurance, Paddy.

80
00:05:31,603 --> 00:05:32,803
Exactly.

81
00:05:32,803 --> 00:05:35,563
Because the excitement and joy
I brought

82
00:05:35,563 --> 00:05:37,883
doesn't cost £3 million

83
00:05:37,883 --> 00:05:40,163
or £300,000.

84
00:05:43,683 --> 00:05:44,843
No.

85
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:47,603
For a truly extraordinary drive

86
00:05:47,603 --> 00:05:50,683
half that buys this.

87
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:56,403
The Porsche Cayman GT4 RS,

88
00:05:56,403 --> 00:06:00,083
The car, they said, would
never happen.

89
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,883
Geeks like me have always
wondered

90
00:06:05,883 --> 00:06:08,923
what a beautiful little mid-engine
Cayman would be like

91
00:06:08,923 --> 00:06:10,723
with proper power.

92
00:06:10,723 --> 00:06:15,043
The answer is predictably
sensational.

93
00:06:18,803 --> 00:06:21,043
After decades of saying it wouldn't,

94
00:06:21,043 --> 00:06:25,643
Porsche has finally taken its
smallest mid-engine sports car...

95
00:06:26,843 --> 00:06:30,163
..and stuffed it with the
500-horsepower flat six

96
00:06:30,163 --> 00:06:32,363
from the 911 GT3.

97
00:06:34,043 --> 00:06:35,683
Well, they were at it,

98
00:06:35,683 --> 00:06:38,323
they added new springs, dampers,
anti-roll bars

99
00:06:38,323 --> 00:06:40,003
and aero,

100
00:06:40,003 --> 00:06:42,403
plus lightweight carbon body panels

101
00:06:42,403 --> 00:06:44,403
and air intakes

102
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,003
just behind your head.

103
00:06:47,443 --> 00:06:50,523
But even though Porsche
has upgraded pretty much every bit

104
00:06:50,523 --> 00:06:52,563
over the standard GT4,

105
00:06:52,563 --> 00:06:56,763
it insists this car isn't about
numbers and lap times.

106
00:06:56,763 --> 00:07:00,683
That's not to ignore the fact
that it's 196mph

107
00:07:00,683 --> 00:07:02,803
and not the 60 in a three and a bit
seconds.

108
00:07:02,803 --> 00:07:05,003
So it's still very, very fast.

109
00:07:07,363 --> 00:07:09,323
But the steering's perfection,

110
00:07:09,323 --> 00:07:11,643
the size is just right.

111
00:07:11,643 --> 00:07:15,203
The Cayman GT4 is the type
of car that makes you forget

112
00:07:15,203 --> 00:07:17,923
about your supercars and hypercars
and asks the question

113
00:07:17,923 --> 00:07:20,203
why do you need anything more?

114
00:07:20,203 --> 00:07:22,123
Woohoo!

115
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,323
Oh, dear, dear, dear.

116
00:07:25,323 --> 00:07:28,123
Christopher, did you not get the
brief?

117
00:07:28,123 --> 00:07:29,483
Supercars?

118
00:07:30,723 --> 00:07:32,763
"Supercar", "hypercar",
they're just labels.

119
00:07:32,763 --> 00:07:35,283
What matters is how much
fun you're having.

120
00:07:35,283 --> 00:07:37,603
And this car is a riot.

121
00:07:37,603 --> 00:07:39,203
I can't even see, Chris.

122
00:07:39,203 --> 00:07:42,123
It's being blocked out by a Pagani.

123
00:07:42,123 --> 00:07:43,923
This might be the baby of the bunch,

124
00:07:43,923 --> 00:07:46,443
but it'll still do 196mph,

125
00:07:46,443 --> 00:07:49,843
which I think is ample
for a clown like you.

126
00:07:51,123 --> 00:07:52,763
I've got to say, I feel
a bit left out.

127
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:56,123
I didn't get the "turn up in
a banana yellow car" memo today.

128
00:07:56,123 --> 00:07:59,283
I'm just in this grey and black
fighter jet.

129
00:07:59,283 --> 00:08:00,563
Come on, Pad, be honest.

130
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,123
Since you got in that thing,
have you managed to unclench?

131
00:08:03,123 --> 00:08:04,843
How much is that thing worth?

132
00:08:04,843 --> 00:08:07,323
£3.2 million, Chris.

133
00:08:07,323 --> 00:08:09,683
Deary me!

134
00:08:12,763 --> 00:08:14,123
With that in mind

135
00:08:14,123 --> 00:08:17,723
because one of the biggest thrills
a great supercar has to give you

136
00:08:17,723 --> 00:08:20,123
is real world speed,

137
00:08:20,123 --> 00:08:24,083
to start finding out what this
remarkable trio really had to offer,

138
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,603
we made our first port of call,

139
00:08:26,603 --> 00:08:29,643
the great driving Mecca, that is...

140
00:08:32,203 --> 00:08:33,923
..the Autobahn.

141
00:08:39,563 --> 00:08:41,083
Chris, show us how it's done.

142
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,483
Me first time.

143
00:08:42,483 --> 00:08:45,163
Here we go, boys.
Right, have a look at this.

144
00:08:45,163 --> 00:08:47,563
So when you see the magic sign,
it looks a bit like

145
00:08:47,563 --> 00:08:50,043
the national speed limit sign of the
UK,

146
00:08:50,043 --> 00:08:52,203
that is when you can go.

147
00:08:52,203 --> 00:08:54,043
There are no limits at that point.

148
00:08:55,683 --> 00:08:58,843
Yes, when the conditions are right,

149
00:08:58,843 --> 00:09:02,403
on the autobahn,
you're legally allowed to go

150
00:09:02,403 --> 00:09:04,243
as fast as you want.

151
00:09:08,763 --> 00:09:10,763
I feel like a caged tiger,

152
00:09:10,763 --> 00:09:12,883
just pacing up and down,
wanting to go.

153
00:09:16,763 --> 00:09:20,403
The only trouble is, in this busy,
modern world of ours,

154
00:09:20,403 --> 00:09:22,203
a lot of the time, the conditions...

155
00:09:23,643 --> 00:09:25,003
..are wrong.

156
00:09:26,283 --> 00:09:29,603
I've got to be honest,
it's not all it's cracked up to be.

157
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:33,723
I've heard stories about it since
I was a kid, and I'm on it now.

158
00:09:33,723 --> 00:09:35,963
I go faster on the A50.

159
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:40,283
We're stuck behind a Ford Galaxy.

160
00:09:42,043 --> 00:09:43,843
Sadly, it's all about time of day,
boys

161
00:09:43,843 --> 00:09:46,563
And we just arrived at
the wrong time of day.

162
00:09:46,563 --> 00:09:49,843
It's Friday, everyone's heading
off for the weekend.

163
00:09:49,843 --> 00:09:52,683
Yeah, we won't be going more than
70mph on here.

164
00:09:54,723 --> 00:09:55,883
Wow.

165
00:09:55,883 --> 00:09:59,043
This is like flying all the way
to the Seychelles

166
00:09:59,043 --> 00:10:01,043
and it's 12 degrees and cloudy.

167
00:10:02,763 --> 00:10:04,483
This is like what I do.

168
00:10:04,483 --> 00:10:06,563
Go to McDonald's and get
a vegan burger.

169
00:10:09,803 --> 00:10:12,203
Or like meeting Paddy McGuinness
and realising

170
00:10:12,203 --> 00:10:14,003
he's just not that funny.

171
00:10:15,443 --> 00:10:17,163
Funny.

172
00:10:17,163 --> 00:10:21,203
# I drive my kia
I can see it...#

173
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:24,003
With the traffic showing no signs
of improving,

174
00:10:24,003 --> 00:10:28,043
we had to chalk up the Autobahn
as unfinished business.

175
00:10:29,603 --> 00:10:32,323
So next we headed for a nearby town

176
00:10:32,323 --> 00:10:34,203
to see what our cars would make

177
00:10:34,203 --> 00:10:36,163
of a bit of urban living.

178
00:10:37,643 --> 00:10:39,963
The only thing I would say
with a Pagani,

179
00:10:39,963 --> 00:10:43,203
driving through these beautiful,
quaint, little roads

180
00:10:43,203 --> 00:10:44,883
with these little cottagey houses,

181
00:10:44,883 --> 00:10:46,883
I feel a little bit...

182
00:10:46,883 --> 00:10:49,163
ooh, a bit, I shouldn't be here.

183
00:10:50,123 --> 00:10:51,803
I think that's progress for you,
Pad.

184
00:10:51,803 --> 00:10:54,203
Usually you just don't care.

185
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:56,603
What is German for I bet the bloke
that drives that

186
00:10:56,603 --> 00:10:58,563
has got a tiny willy?

187
00:10:58,563 --> 00:11:01,083
It's Herr Chris Harris.

188
00:11:02,923 --> 00:11:04,643
Anyhow, Pad, the active aero

189
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:06,643
should prove crucial around the

190
00:11:06,643 --> 00:11:08,643
urban streets of Rosenheim.

191
00:11:15,843 --> 00:11:18,803
I'm starting to feel a bit smug now,
boys.

192
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,523
Because on the open road

193
00:11:20,523 --> 00:11:23,363
I reckon I was having as much,
if not more, fun.

194
00:11:23,363 --> 00:11:25,923
And right now my, um...

195
00:11:25,923 --> 00:11:28,723
..a certain
part of my body isn't biting a hole

196
00:11:28,723 --> 00:11:30,203
in the seat like it is for you two.

197
00:11:30,203 --> 00:11:32,083
I'm more good at it, Chris.

198
00:11:33,523 --> 00:11:36,163
I'm just going to pop it into
electric mode.

199
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:37,363
Here we go.

200
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,683
Oh, that is smug, actually.

201
00:11:39,683 --> 00:11:41,003
That's definitely smug.

202
00:11:41,003 --> 00:11:44,203
It's a proper hybrid, the  296.

203
00:11:45,323 --> 00:11:48,403
I get 15 odd miles or so just
pottering about in electric.

204
00:11:49,723 --> 00:11:51,403
It's responsible, it's green.

205
00:11:52,443 --> 00:11:54,443
Can't be said about that Pagani,
though, can it?

206
00:11:54,443 --> 00:11:56,003
Nothing green about that.

207
00:11:57,163 --> 00:11:58,403
No, there isn't.

208
00:11:58,403 --> 00:12:02,443
And, as it turns out, there's also
plenty of other reasons

209
00:12:02,443 --> 00:12:05,363
not to take your three million quid
Pagani

210
00:12:05,363 --> 00:12:07,803
into town for a bratwurst.

211
00:12:07,803 --> 00:12:09,283
Oh.

212
00:12:09,283 --> 00:12:12,283
Narrow here, breathe in, Pad,
breathe in.

213
00:12:12,283 --> 00:12:14,523
Oh, that's tight.

214
00:12:17,523 --> 00:12:19,883
Rather you than me with that thing.

215
00:12:20,883 --> 00:12:22,363
Well, at least no-one's looking.

216
00:12:23,523 --> 00:12:25,523
I've never been as

217
00:12:25,523 --> 00:12:28,203
self-conscious
and embarrassed in my life.

218
00:12:30,803 --> 00:12:33,283
Do you know what I've just done,
which is really pathetic?

219
00:12:33,283 --> 00:12:36,483
I've turned it off electric then the
engine makes a noise.

220
00:12:36,483 --> 00:12:38,283
How sad is that?

221
00:12:40,603 --> 00:12:43,083
I'm not driving
around in electric gear.

222
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:46,243
I want to make a noise.
I'm in a Ferrari, bright yellow.

223
00:12:47,883 --> 00:12:51,243
Sad or not, Flintoff had landed
on a crucial point

224
00:12:51,243 --> 00:12:54,043
about the Supercar experience,

225
00:12:54,043 --> 00:12:57,323
one that needed more discussion over
a sit down

226
00:12:57,323 --> 00:12:59,163
with a sausage.

227
00:12:59,163 --> 00:13:01,003
Do you know what I don't understand?
What?

228
00:13:01,003 --> 00:13:03,563
Being in Germany you go with...
Now in the UK,

229
00:13:03,563 --> 00:13:05,403
I'll have that on a brioche roll.

230
00:13:06,523 --> 00:13:07,923
Soft...

231
00:13:07,923 --> 00:13:09,763
..as a crusty cob.

232
00:13:09,763 --> 00:13:13,003
I don't think it goes with
a...  It's a great sausage.

233
00:13:13,003 --> 00:13:14,723
I'm not disputing that.

234
00:13:14,723 --> 00:13:18,443
Sitting here, mine does look a bit
undernourished, I have to say.

235
00:13:18,443 --> 00:13:19,843
As I was saying,

236
00:13:19,843 --> 00:13:22,243
that car that's in the middle of
those two

237
00:13:22,243 --> 00:13:24,323
has gone invisible, it's crazy.

238
00:13:24,323 --> 00:13:27,603
I've got to say, though,
the more I look at the Ferrari,
the more I'm enjoying it.

239
00:13:27,603 --> 00:13:30,163
Loved it from the start and it's
getting better, Lovely thing.

240
00:13:30,163 --> 00:13:31,923
It's not fair being next to that,
though.

241
00:13:32,883 --> 00:13:36,803
It looks better than that.
It doesn't draw as much attention,
though, does it, that's the thing.

242
00:13:36,803 --> 00:13:39,043
Well, why do you want the attention?
It's a supercar.

243
00:13:40,123 --> 00:13:42,203
Supercar, hypercar, whatever you
want to call it,

244
00:13:42,203 --> 00:13:44,083
needs to be like that in my eye.

245
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,403
I'm going to be really honest
here, right.

246
00:13:46,403 --> 00:13:48,763
If you get a car like that...  Yeah.

247
00:13:48,763 --> 00:13:50,283
..I don't care what you say,

248
00:13:50,283 --> 00:13:51,803
you want to be seen a little bit.

249
00:13:51,803 --> 00:13:53,683
Of course you do.  Even Chris Harris.

250
00:13:53,683 --> 00:13:55,243
It's a £3.2 million car.

251
00:13:55,243 --> 00:13:56,643
You want to show it off a bit.

252
00:13:56,643 --> 00:13:58,803
One thing I've been wondering
about, Paddy....

253
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:02,723
..where's the roof on your car?
Where'd you put it?

254
00:14:04,403 --> 00:14:06,163
Great question.

255
00:14:06,163 --> 00:14:08,283
See down at the back there?  Yeah.

256
00:14:08,283 --> 00:14:10,003
Under there?  Down there.

257
00:14:10,003 --> 00:14:13,443
Now just kind of cast your eye a
bit further across the square

258
00:14:13,443 --> 00:14:15,643
and then right over there, see that
grey van?

259
00:14:15,643 --> 00:14:17,403
That's where it is.

260
00:14:18,563 --> 00:14:21,603
There's no-where for it?  You have a
man following you with the roof?

261
00:14:21,603 --> 00:14:23,003
Yeah, he follows you around,

262
00:14:23,003 --> 00:14:24,523
life's good, and also as well,

263
00:14:24,523 --> 00:14:26,683
let me show you this,
little extra this.

264
00:14:26,683 --> 00:14:29,843
It comes with a set of exclusive
luggage.

265
00:14:29,843 --> 00:14:32,083
Comes with an absolute pillock
driving it as well.

266
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,203
He thinks this is his car.

267
00:14:33,203 --> 00:14:36,643
Normally I'm doing this, but
normally me man in the van does
this for me.

268
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:38,363
Pop that open.  Yeah.

269
00:14:38,363 --> 00:14:40,203
Beautiful.

270
00:14:40,203 --> 00:14:42,563
That couldn't...  Look at your car.

271
00:14:42,563 --> 00:14:46,083
That couldn't look less like your
car. It's so obvious you've never
done that before.

272
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:48,523
What have you got in there? Make-up?
That's my luggage.

273
00:14:48,523 --> 00:14:49,963
What would you fit in there?

274
00:14:49,963 --> 00:14:53,283
If you want the luggage option,
you're looking at around about an
extra 30 grand.

275
00:14:53,283 --> 00:14:55,163
I know you think that's a lot of
money, but...

276
00:14:55,163 --> 00:14:57,483
I don't think
it is, that's a lot of money.

277
00:14:57,483 --> 00:14:58,883
That's the price of a new car.

278
00:14:58,883 --> 00:15:01,883
We're not finished.
Same set of luggage on this side.

279
00:15:01,883 --> 00:15:03,203
And...

280
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:05,643
..the key.

281
00:15:05,643 --> 00:15:07,283
Well, go on, then.
Let's have a look.

282
00:15:07,283 --> 00:15:09,083
What's... What's that?

283
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:13,123
The exact shape and replica
of the car. Look at it.

284
00:15:13,123 --> 00:15:15,363
Right.  You imagine you're out at -

285
00:15:15,363 --> 00:15:17,723
what's a posh restaurant? - Nando's.

286
00:15:17,723 --> 00:15:19,243
Everyone's got their BMW keys.

287
00:15:19,243 --> 00:15:21,603
You go, bosh. "There's my key."

288
00:15:21,603 --> 00:15:24,603
Shape of a car, 20 quid.
No.  Yeah.

289
00:15:24,603 --> 00:15:26,963
You're not comparing them two.

290
00:15:26,963 --> 00:15:29,683
Yeah.  So when you go to...
Even feel the weight of that.

291
00:15:29,683 --> 00:15:31,203
It's nothing. That's weighty.

292
00:15:31,203 --> 00:15:34,283
It's basically a Corgi toy
in your pocket wherever you go.

293
00:15:34,283 --> 00:15:36,803
The problem with that is,
I've got a two-and-a-half year old.

294
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,723
PADDY MAKES CAR SOUNDS
Invisible.

295
00:15:38,723 --> 00:15:40,763
Invisible.
PADDY MAKES CAR SOUNDS

296
00:15:40,763 --> 00:15:41,803
Love it!

297
00:15:41,803 --> 00:15:43,443
THEY LAUGH

298
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,883
Now just let's sit down and enjoy
our steins of lemonade.

299
00:15:46,883 --> 00:15:49,123
GLASSES CLINK Cheers.  Solid clunk.

300
00:15:54,963 --> 00:15:57,003
Aah! Come on, lads.

301
00:15:57,003 --> 00:15:58,843
What on earth is he made of?

302
00:15:58,843 --> 00:16:00,003
Did you see that?

303
00:16:01,523 --> 00:16:02,643
PADDY BELCHES

304
00:16:02,643 --> 00:16:04,763
How's he done that.

305
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,283
ENGINE REVS

306
00:16:06,283 --> 00:16:11,243
So, it had been an informative
first day in supercar land.

307
00:16:11,243 --> 00:16:16,523
After all, it's reassuring to think
that while the owner of a £3 million

308
00:16:16,523 --> 00:16:19,203
Pagani's life is full of drama,

309
00:16:19,203 --> 00:16:22,443
it's not always
drama of the good kind.

310
00:16:22,443 --> 00:16:25,483
ENGINES ROAR AND EXHAUSTS BURBLE

311
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:30,203
What I pulled away then, and
that shocked me how quick this was.

312
00:16:30,203 --> 00:16:33,763
And I honestly think I'd have paid
a bit extra for some clean underwear

313
00:16:33,763 --> 00:16:35,963
in the boot cos it does
get a bit twitchy.

314
00:16:35,963 --> 00:16:38,043
Ah-ha!

315
00:16:38,043 --> 00:16:41,963
And speaking of drama, it's
gratifying to know that the best

316
00:16:41,963 --> 00:16:46,363
soundtrack of our three doesn't come
from the ultra exclusive Huayra,

317
00:16:46,363 --> 00:16:49,483
or even the Maranello thoroughbred.

318
00:16:49,483 --> 00:16:51,043
Listen to this.

319
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:54,043
EXHAUST NOTE ROARS

320
00:16:54,043 --> 00:16:55,083
Wow!

321
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:57,323
What a noise!

322
00:16:59,123 --> 00:17:02,723
But with the sun setting
over the foothills of the Alps,

323
00:17:02,723 --> 00:17:06,403
the best part was that our
great super car experiment

324
00:17:06,403 --> 00:17:08,923
was just getting started.

325
00:17:08,923 --> 00:17:13,243
Lads, do you fancy a trip
on the autobahn on the way back?

326
00:17:13,243 --> 00:17:15,403
Don't see why not.

327
00:17:15,403 --> 00:17:17,563
I think we need a dab of speed.

328
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,563
Oh, yes.

329
00:17:21,563 --> 00:17:25,483
It was time to settle
that unfinished business.

330
00:17:27,403 --> 00:17:29,443
Let's get on with it, boys.
Come on.

331
00:17:31,243 --> 00:17:33,643
I've got that nervous excitement.

332
00:17:35,643 --> 00:17:39,843
Now, when it comes to running on the
derestricted autobahn,

333
00:17:39,843 --> 00:17:43,563
there's one thing, above all else,
you need to know.

334
00:17:45,323 --> 00:17:51,563
It is a drive that requires
more concentration than any drive

335
00:17:51,563 --> 00:17:53,723
you've ever done in your life.

336
00:17:55,963 --> 00:17:57,603
Derestrict now, boys.

337
00:17:57,603 --> 00:17:59,523
ENGINE ROARS

338
00:18:42,843 --> 00:18:45,323

00:18:47,523 --> 00:18:49,403
Whoa.

341
00:18:49,403 --> 00:18:52,043
Man alive!

342
00:18:56,203 --> 00:18:57,963
This is incredible.

343
00:18:57,963 --> 00:19:00,243
This car is incredible.

344
00:19:00,243 --> 00:19:03,043
Oh, I'm pleased as punch that
we got to have a proper go.

345
00:19:03,043 --> 00:19:05,323
I'm pleased as punch.

346
00:19:05,323 --> 00:19:08,843
Imagine coming here and just sitting
in a town square eating sausage.

347
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:20,243
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

348
00:19:24,043 --> 00:19:29,203
I felt like a proud dad taking two
young pups for their first run

349
00:19:29,203 --> 00:19:31,123
on the Autobahn. Well done.
Right.

350
00:19:31,123 --> 00:19:35,363
Now, the idea of this film is how
these super cars make you feel.

351
00:19:35,363 --> 00:19:39,283
Yeah.  Now, I can tell you on that
autobahn in that Pagani,

352
00:19:39,283 --> 00:19:42,003
I felt bloody terrified.

353
00:19:42,003 --> 00:19:48,043
I mean, in the dark
roof off, so visceral, felt so fast.

354
00:19:48,043 --> 00:19:51,643
Now, it wasn't a competition, but do
you want to know how fast you went?

355
00:19:51,643 --> 00:19:54,803
Oh, yeah.
It's got to be easy 250.

356
00:19:54,803 --> 00:19:57,243
I heard a sonic boom at one point.

357
00:19:57,243 --> 00:19:59,083
LAUGHTER Unbelievable.

358
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:02,683
OK, well, you actually did 167mph.

359
00:20:02,683 --> 00:20:05,763
That'll do.  That's all right,
innit..  It felt faster.
..with the roof down?

360
00:20:05,763 --> 00:20:09,163
It felt faster.  Now, in the little
Porsche I did 172mph.

361
00:20:09,163 --> 00:20:10,563
Oh, wow.  Wow.  Again, all legally.

362
00:20:10,563 --> 00:20:14,003
Yeah.  Fred, 174mph in the Ferrari.

363
00:20:14,003 --> 00:20:15,203
Still wanted to keep going.

364
00:20:15,203 --> 00:20:16,803
Yeah.  It's barely in its stride,
is it?

365
00:20:16,803 --> 00:20:18,443
Because the Ferrari was the
quickest.

366
00:20:18,443 --> 00:20:21,763
But the thing is, it was so serene,
it didn't even feel

367
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:23,283
like it was breaking a sweat.

368
00:20:23,283 --> 00:20:26,483
I did enough sweating
for all of us in that Pagani.

369
00:20:26,483 --> 00:20:28,203
Shall we move on?
Yes, please do.

370
00:20:28,203 --> 00:20:30,243
We'll get back to our supercars
later in the show.

371
00:20:30,243 --> 00:20:34,243
But now we need to talk
about these - micro cars.

372
00:20:34,243 --> 00:20:37,603
Tiny little pods
designed for busy cities.

373
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:40,203
Back in the '50s and '60s,
there was a whole rash

374
00:20:40,203 --> 00:20:42,603
of these things, but they never
really caught on.

375
00:20:42,603 --> 00:20:45,123
But now micro cars are back
in a big way.

376
00:20:45,123 --> 00:20:46,403
Well, a small way.

377
00:20:46,403 --> 00:20:49,123
And we decided it was time to run
the magnifying glass over some

378
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:51,163
of the latest tiniest offerings.

379
00:20:56,523 --> 00:20:57,803
HORN TOOTS

380
00:20:59,403 --> 00:21:04,283
Where better to explore the brave
new world of electric mini city cars

381
00:21:04,283 --> 00:21:08,323
than that most popular of
mini break cities - Paris?

382
00:21:11,883 --> 00:21:15,843
And because France loves
these microcars more than most,

383
00:21:15,843 --> 00:21:20,283
say a big bienvenue to
the Citroen Ami.

384
00:21:23,203 --> 00:21:25,523
First things first,
this isn't even a car, technically -

385
00:21:25,523 --> 00:21:27,963
it's a quadricycle.

386
00:21:29,763 --> 00:21:32,883
Which means it's about
pure minimalism -

387
00:21:32,883 --> 00:21:34,643
stripping everything out
you don't need,

388
00:21:34,643 --> 00:21:36,803
so there's no rear-view mirror,
no central locking,

389
00:21:36,803 --> 00:21:39,883
there's a very basic fan
and heated front screen.

390
00:21:39,883 --> 00:21:43,363
The seats are just two cushions
plunked on some solid plastic.

391
00:21:45,123 --> 00:21:46,403
BIKE BELL RINGS

392
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,803
It'll do 30mph, flat out.

393
00:21:49,803 --> 00:21:51,683
It's not even allowed on a motorway.

394
00:21:51,683 --> 00:21:54,003
Yeah, it couldn't be more basic.

395
00:21:54,003 --> 00:21:55,883
MOPED REVS

396
00:21:57,163 --> 00:22:01,203
In fact, the Ami's tiny
proportions, limited performance

397
00:22:01,203 --> 00:22:06,083
and simplistic design mean
that here in France you can drive

398
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:08,363
one from the age of 14.

399
00:22:11,043 --> 00:22:15,003
Quite what that means for the rest
of France's drivers, of course,

400
00:22:15,003 --> 00:22:16,683
remains to be seen.

401
00:22:16,683 --> 00:22:22,883
But around town right now in Paris,
it might just be the perfect fit.

402
00:22:25,403 --> 00:22:26,683
Very nice.

403
00:22:26,683 --> 00:22:30,603
But if you want to get to those
spots your average city car

404
00:22:30,603 --> 00:22:35,963
won't reach,
you'll be wanting one of these.

405
00:22:35,963 --> 00:22:37,523
A Carver.

406
00:22:39,923 --> 00:22:46,843
Now, this three-wheeled wonder
starts at around £12,000.

407
00:22:46,843 --> 00:22:53,083
It comes from the Netherlands,
and it's a very generous tipper.

408
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:55,723
Whoa-ho-ho!

409
00:22:59,883 --> 00:23:02,683
Carvers have been around
for a long time now.

410
00:23:02,683 --> 00:23:06,323
But this is the new
electric version.

411
00:23:06,323 --> 00:23:09,843
Wah-hey-hey-hey!

412
00:23:09,843 --> 00:23:12,803
Yep, all of the tilt,

413
00:23:12,803 --> 00:23:14,563
none of the guilt.

414
00:23:14,563 --> 00:23:17,563
The only thing with the Carver,
this particular one, is you do need

415
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,523
a bike licence to drive it.

416
00:23:20,643 --> 00:23:23,203
But no crash helmet.

417
00:23:23,203 --> 00:23:25,843
So you're never going to mess
your hair up.

418
00:23:25,843 --> 00:23:27,083
Them were the days.

419
00:23:30,923 --> 00:23:36,043
And besides, if you ever do get
over the sheer joy of how it works

420
00:23:36,043 --> 00:23:41,723
in this eight horsepower S+ model,
you've also got a 50mph top speed

421
00:23:41,723 --> 00:23:43,963
and a 62-mile range.

422
00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:48,643
That might just make this
the ultimate urban micro machine.

423
00:23:51,523 --> 00:23:53,683
Nipping in and out of traffic,

424
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:55,563
looking at the sights,

425
00:23:55,563 --> 00:23:57,043
tilting about,

426
00:23:57,043 --> 00:23:58,243
wonderful.

427
00:23:59,763 --> 00:24:01,243
Maybe.

428
00:24:01,243 --> 00:24:05,563
But if you want a city car
with a proper secret superpower,

429
00:24:05,563 --> 00:24:08,083
there is another way.

430
00:24:11,803 --> 00:24:17,283
The City Transformer CT-1
is made by an Israeli start-up,

431
00:24:17,283 --> 00:24:22,003
and it's packing a mighty
20 horsepower.

432
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:25,083
And if you think it's not
that ground-breaking,

433
00:24:25,083 --> 00:24:26,683
just have a look at this.

434
00:24:30,043 --> 00:24:33,243
Literally, honey, I shrunk the car.

435
00:24:38,363 --> 00:24:40,403
What you need is narrowness.

436
00:24:42,883 --> 00:24:46,043
But the problem we've really
narrow cars is when you get them

437
00:24:46,043 --> 00:24:49,683
out on the open road and fast
corners, well, they tend

438
00:24:49,683 --> 00:24:50,963
to fall over.

439
00:24:54,803 --> 00:24:56,963
I'll never get bored of that.

440
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:58,883
It is a proper Transformer.

441
00:25:00,563 --> 00:25:02,603
Well, almost.

442
00:25:02,603 --> 00:25:09,323
The CT-1 is so brand-new that this
Transformer's still a prototype,

443
00:25:09,323 --> 00:25:12,563
but it will eventually cost
about 13-grand.

444
00:25:12,563 --> 00:25:13,603
Ooh.

445
00:25:13,603 --> 00:25:15,843
And while that might be more than
the other two,

446
00:25:15,843 --> 00:25:19,163
here you get over 100 miles of
range,

447
00:25:19,163 --> 00:25:21,563
a 56mph top speed,

448
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:25,363
and plenty of attention.

449
00:25:25,363 --> 00:25:26,403
Hey-hey-hey!

450
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:30,763
They love it, the Parisians.

451
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:32,123
Oh, mais oui!

452
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:38,363
I'm just showing off now.

453
00:25:38,363 --> 00:25:39,843
Here we go.

454
00:25:39,843 --> 00:25:42,883
Tell you what, I am that
focused on my wheels,

455
00:25:42,883 --> 00:25:45,603
I've just noticed the Eiffel Tower
in my mirror behind.

456
00:25:45,603 --> 00:25:47,043
Didn't even see it.

457
00:25:50,603 --> 00:25:56,083
Now, to see how our remarkable micro
cars really took to city living,

458
00:25:56,083 --> 00:26:00,363
we'd agreed to meet up with them
at the Arc de Triomphe,

459
00:26:00,363 --> 00:26:03,203
which, of course,
is also one of Europe's

460
00:26:03,203 --> 00:26:06,803
finest, busiest roundabouts.

461
00:26:06,803 --> 00:26:07,963
HORNS HONK

462
00:26:07,963 --> 00:26:09,363
Oh, that was a good move.

463
00:26:09,363 --> 00:26:11,803
A good move from the Citroen DS.

464
00:26:12,803 --> 00:26:14,923
As long as you keep your eyes
peeled, it's great fun.

465
00:26:14,923 --> 00:26:17,163
It's like real life dodgems really.

466
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:21,043
Oh! It's out the way.

467
00:26:21,043 --> 00:26:22,203
My God.

468
00:26:22,203 --> 00:26:23,483
Oh, my word.

469
00:26:23,483 --> 00:26:26,523
You've got to have your wits
about you on here, haven't you?

470
00:26:26,523 --> 00:26:27,883
There's Paddy. All right, Pad?

471
00:26:27,883 --> 00:26:29,163
HORN TOOTS

472
00:26:29,163 --> 00:26:31,043
Get over, you bloody nutter!

473
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:36,363
Treat it like a game of Mario Kart

474
00:26:36,363 --> 00:26:39,643
and you'll be just about there,
chaps.

475
00:26:39,643 --> 00:26:43,163
Look at this!
There's pedestrians running over!

476
00:26:43,163 --> 00:26:46,163
I tell you what, Fred, that thing
looks like it's about fall over

477
00:26:46,163 --> 00:26:47,243
from where I'm sitting.

478
00:26:47,243 --> 00:26:48,483
HORNS TOOT

479
00:26:48,483 --> 00:26:49,923
Here comes the bus.

480
00:26:49,923 --> 00:26:51,203
Stay there!

481
00:26:51,203 --> 00:26:52,243
HORN BLARES

482
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:55,483
That was close, Fred.
That was close, that was close.

483
00:26:55,483 --> 00:26:58,603
Deciding that six complete orbits
of the Arc de Triomphe

484
00:26:58,603 --> 00:27:01,043
was probably enough...

485
00:27:01,043 --> 00:27:02,443
I'm getting dizzy.

486
00:27:02,443 --> 00:27:05,283
How do we actually
get off this roundabout?

487
00:27:05,283 --> 00:27:08,563
..we eventually manoeuvred
ourselves out of the chaos...

488
00:27:08,563 --> 00:27:11,523
He's brave bringing that here.
Madness!

489
00:27:11,523 --> 00:27:14,603
..and headed on to
the Champs-Elysees.

490
00:27:14,603 --> 00:27:17,643
MUSIC: Bongo Cha Cha Cha
by Caterina Valente

491
00:27:19,843 --> 00:27:22,523
Watch this, boys. The Transformer.

492
00:27:22,523 --> 00:27:24,163
Are you ready?

493
00:27:24,163 --> 00:27:26,283
THEY CHEER

494
00:27:27,843 --> 00:27:30,523
Oh, yes, my son.
That's fantastic.

495
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:32,803
Get in!
That's a belter!

496
00:27:32,803 --> 00:27:34,523
HE LAUGHS

497
00:27:34,523 --> 00:27:36,443
Yours tilts, mine transforms.

498
00:27:36,443 --> 00:27:38,003
Lovely stuff!

499
00:27:38,003 --> 00:27:40,403
HE CHUCKLES

500
00:27:40,403 --> 00:27:43,723
# Bongo la, bongo cha cha cha... #

501
00:27:43,723 --> 00:27:46,403
Here we go, lads.
Off the beaten track.

502
00:27:46,403 --> 00:27:49,603
That's the beauty
of these little rascals.

503
00:27:49,603 --> 00:27:51,763
You feel like you're beating
the system, or doing

504
00:27:51,763 --> 00:27:53,963
something you shouldn't -
I really like it.

505
00:27:56,923 --> 00:27:58,763
Fancy a le cafe?

506
00:28:00,283 --> 00:28:02,243
Trois expressos s'il vous plait.

507
00:28:05,123 --> 00:28:06,843
Last car pays, eh, Pad?

508
00:28:06,843 --> 00:28:07,883
It was good?  Merci.

509
00:28:09,123 --> 00:28:10,723
French kiss.

510
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:13,923
And once you've had your fill of
cafe culture,

511
00:28:13,923 --> 00:28:17,963
no Parisian mini break
would be complete without a quick

512
00:28:17,963 --> 00:28:20,203
spin around the shops.

513
00:28:20,203 --> 00:28:22,283
It's not cheap, Paris, is it, Pad?

514
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,963
Jeez, look at the prices!

515
00:28:25,843 --> 00:28:28,363
Oh, we've got gridlock in Givenchy.

516
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:33,083
I might have a prang in Prada.

517
00:28:35,163 --> 00:28:38,123
I don't why I'm going like this.
I'm going to have a Fendi bender.

518
00:28:38,123 --> 00:28:39,803
Get it? Fendi bender.

519
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:41,323
PADDY LAUGHS DISGUSTEDLY

520
00:28:42,803 --> 00:28:45,763
While a bit of windscreen
shopping might be all well

521
00:28:45,763 --> 00:28:48,363
and good, though...  Merci.

522
00:28:48,363 --> 00:28:50,763
..to see which of these
miniature miracles

523
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:54,203
was really best at slicing
through city streets...

524
00:28:55,643 --> 00:28:59,283
..we've been told to head
up to the stunning

525
00:28:59,283 --> 00:29:00,843
Sacre-Coeur Basilica.

526
00:29:04,283 --> 00:29:05,763
Oh, look at this.

527
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:08,243
Beautiful.

528
00:29:10,723 --> 00:29:12,643
Scissor doors!

529
00:29:12,643 --> 00:29:13,803
Lovely stuff!

530
00:29:13,803 --> 00:29:15,203
It's like a Lamborghini, Fred.

531
00:29:16,203 --> 00:29:18,643
Look at that view.
Look at this. This is lovely.

532
00:29:18,643 --> 00:29:19,803
Oh, yes.

533
00:29:19,803 --> 00:29:24,643
A magnificent view of the city
about to be made that little

534
00:29:24,643 --> 00:29:26,923
bit more...French.

535
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,243
Bonjour.  He's giving it all...
He's gabbing on a bit.

536
00:29:31,243 --> 00:29:35,283
No city mini break would be complete
without a bit of celebrity spotting.

537
00:29:35,283 --> 00:29:39,043
You will now race to get as many
selfies as possible with the famous

538
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:41,163
faces we have placed
around the city.

539
00:29:41,163 --> 00:29:45,363
Be at the Eiffel Tower before time's
up, or you will be disqualified.

540
00:29:45,363 --> 00:29:47,523
Got it.
Spotting celebrities.

541
00:29:47,523 --> 00:29:49,603
Hey, found one. F-...

542
00:29:49,603 --> 00:29:51,043
Oh, no, sorry.

543
00:29:51,043 --> 00:29:53,283
HE LAUGHS

544
00:29:56,083 --> 00:30:00,883
So, in what might politely
be described as an imaginative way

545
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:03,603
of testing three new
urban microcars,

546
00:30:03,603 --> 00:30:06,563
we would now have two hours
to squeeze through

547
00:30:06,563 --> 00:30:09,883
the bustling Parisian traffic

548
00:30:09,883 --> 00:30:12,963
in a bid to find as many
of the waxworks celebrities

549
00:30:12,963 --> 00:30:15,923
that have been dotted
around the city as possible.

550
00:30:17,163 --> 00:30:20,283
Now, only a few of those
celebrities were living.

551
00:30:20,283 --> 00:30:22,803
Many were French.

552
00:30:22,803 --> 00:30:25,523
Some were none of the above.

553
00:30:27,163 --> 00:30:31,123
So to help us on our way, we'd each
been armed with a map to the stars

554
00:30:31,123 --> 00:30:32,443
to locate them...

555
00:30:32,443 --> 00:30:33,643
Oh, my God.

556
00:30:33,643 --> 00:30:35,843
It's all in bloody French.

557
00:30:35,843 --> 00:30:38,283
..and a sat nav to get us there.

558
00:30:38,283 --> 00:30:39,443
Here we go.

559
00:30:39,443 --> 00:30:42,243
Life is a box of chocolates.

560
00:30:42,243 --> 00:30:46,003
And for a final dusting
of Gallic flavour, the winner

561
00:30:46,003 --> 00:30:48,883
would be the driver that got
to the Eiffel Tower

562
00:30:48,883 --> 00:30:54,163
having bereted and selfied the most
celebs before the two hours were up.

563
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:57,443
Ooh, very exciting.

564
00:31:01,003 --> 00:31:05,083
Three, two, one,

565
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:06,963
go!

566
00:31:06,963 --> 00:31:08,243
Right, we're away.

567
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:12,803
Oh, he's gone in the little Citroen.

568
00:31:12,803 --> 00:31:13,843
Here we go.

569
00:31:15,523 --> 00:31:21,163
Edith Piaf is actually only 700
yards away, so I'm in for a chance

570
00:31:21,163 --> 00:31:23,243
of striking first blood here.

571
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,563
Oh.

572
00:31:26,563 --> 00:31:28,963
What a day for spotting
famous folk.

573
00:31:30,203 --> 00:31:32,683
I'm going to get into Paris,
I'm going to get in the mixer,

574
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:37,243
pick them off one by one - Tom
Hanks, Van Gogh, Charles De Gaulle.

575
00:31:39,283 --> 00:31:43,163
An Ami on the cobbled streets
of northern Paris.

576
00:31:43,163 --> 00:31:47,363
Just built this. It's like
a Formula 1 car Spa this is.

577
00:31:49,323 --> 00:31:52,803
Every corner you go around,
you feel like Rossi.

578
00:31:55,803 --> 00:31:57,603
Where is Edith?

579
00:31:57,603 --> 00:32:00,283
I'm going to have to get out
and look for her.

580
00:32:00,283 --> 00:32:02,163
Where's bloody Edith Piaf?

581
00:32:02,163 --> 00:32:04,883
So Harris has got red berets,

582
00:32:04,883 --> 00:32:07,003
Fred's got blue,
and I've got the white ones.

583
00:32:07,003 --> 00:32:10,123
So if I see any blue or red
I know they've got there before me.

584
00:32:10,123 --> 00:32:11,723
Wheels in.

585
00:32:15,483 --> 00:32:18,403
Coming into its own,
this little thing, the Transformer.

586
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:21,003
Wheels in, I get through
all the gaps.

587
00:32:22,323 --> 00:32:23,363
Oh, my God.

588
00:32:24,963 --> 00:32:26,683
She's very small.

589
00:32:26,683 --> 00:32:27,963
Oh, he's found one.

590
00:32:27,963 --> 00:32:29,563
He's found one. Damn him!

591
00:32:29,563 --> 00:32:31,243
SHUTTER CLICKS

592
00:32:31,243 --> 00:32:34,123
Right, Steve Jobs,
let's be having you.

593
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:37,363
Right, we're off.

594
00:32:39,323 --> 00:32:41,523
First blood to the Ami.

595
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:46,883
And while next I set my sights
on influential

596
00:32:46,883 --> 00:32:49,123
novelist Marcel Proust,

597
00:32:49,123 --> 00:32:54,283
so far Flintoff had only found
a street that even his Transformer

598
00:32:54,283 --> 00:32:56,003
couldn't squeeze down.

599
00:32:56,003 --> 00:32:57,723
Come on.

600
00:32:57,723 --> 00:32:59,323
It's gridlock.

601
00:32:59,323 --> 00:33:01,563
I'm in gridlock. Ah!

602
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,483
I'm going down here.
I'm making my own route.

603
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:04,723
Let's go!

604
00:33:07,243 --> 00:33:10,403
Better still, after 20 minutes
on the move,

605
00:33:10,403 --> 00:33:13,563
McGuinness's hunt for Steve
Jobs was heating up

606
00:33:13,563 --> 00:33:15,083
for all the wrong reasons.

607
00:33:17,163 --> 00:33:19,923
Literally the hottest car on Earth,
and I'm in it.

608
00:33:19,923 --> 00:33:23,203
No aircon, no fans.

609
00:33:23,203 --> 00:33:27,243
Just a massive piece of glass
magnifying the sun's rays

610
00:33:27,243 --> 00:33:29,643
onto the top of my thinning hair!

611
00:33:29,643 --> 00:33:30,683
HORN TOOTS

612
00:33:31,763 --> 00:33:35,763
Plus, over in the prototype
City Transformer,

613
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:39,123
Flintoff's day was about to
get worse.

614
00:33:39,123 --> 00:33:41,443
It's starting to smell a bit
burny in here.

615
00:33:41,443 --> 00:33:43,443
I'm going to pull in here.

616
00:33:43,443 --> 00:33:45,163
Jeez.

617
00:33:45,163 --> 00:33:46,883
What a disaster.

618
00:33:46,883 --> 00:33:49,043
Absolute disaster.

619
00:33:49,043 --> 00:33:53,483
And as the people who built it
rushed in to diagnose the problem...

620
00:33:53,483 --> 00:33:55,723
It's starting to smell a bit
in here.

621
00:33:55,723 --> 00:33:59,043
..McGuinness might have finally
got the Jobs in hand.

622
00:33:59,043 --> 00:34:01,763
Oh, my God. There's Steve Jobs.
I can see him!

623
00:34:02,723 --> 00:34:05,883
But over at the Place de la
Concorde, the little Ami

624
00:34:05,883 --> 00:34:08,683
and I were already scampering up...

625
00:34:08,683 --> 00:34:10,963
Marcel Proust. There he is.

626
00:34:10,963 --> 00:34:13,043
..to our second celeb.

627
00:34:13,043 --> 00:34:14,483
One of the greats.

628
00:34:14,483 --> 00:34:15,803
SHUTTER CLICKS

629
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,883
Hey, I tell you, that's a good one,
that, n'all.

630
00:34:17,883 --> 00:34:19,003
SHUTTER CLICKS

631
00:34:19,003 --> 00:34:25,483
So that's Ami, two, Carver, one,
Transformer, nil points.

632
00:34:25,483 --> 00:34:28,523
Can you smell it?
Yeah. It's too hot.

633
00:34:28,523 --> 00:34:32,843
Optimus was still getting back
to his prime, and this was starting

634
00:34:32,843 --> 00:34:35,643
to look like a two-horse race.

635
00:34:38,003 --> 00:34:39,843
Tom Hanks, allez.

636
00:34:41,203 --> 00:34:44,963
But while Harris might have had
an early advantage, on the sticky

637
00:34:44,963 --> 00:34:50,723
streets of Paris, the little Carver
was just starting to shine.

638
00:34:50,723 --> 00:34:53,763
Oh. Oh-ho. I can see young Mozart.

639
00:34:53,763 --> 00:34:55,203
Look at this lad.

640
00:34:55,203 --> 00:34:58,403
That's literally like
little Chris Harris.

641
00:34:58,403 --> 00:35:00,403
School uniform.

642
00:35:00,403 --> 00:35:02,843
SHUTTER CLICKS

643
00:35:02,843 --> 00:35:07,323
Back with the Transformer,
we were up and running again.

644
00:35:07,323 --> 00:35:10,923
But with time running away,
I needed a new target.

645
00:35:10,923 --> 00:35:12,723
Come on, then, Ryan Gosling.

646
00:35:16,283 --> 00:35:18,203
Hello!  What are you...? Go away!

647
00:35:18,203 --> 00:35:21,563
Oh, Flintoff, look at the way
he can get through there.

648
00:35:21,563 --> 00:35:23,283
Oh, that's appalling!

649
00:35:23,283 --> 00:35:24,923
Hey-hey-hey!

650
00:35:27,243 --> 00:35:29,323
Yes, please.

651
00:35:29,323 --> 00:35:31,683
Coming through.

652
00:35:31,683 --> 00:35:34,323
Look at him, he's just wending
his way, he's making an extra lane

653
00:35:34,323 --> 00:35:35,723
for himself.

654
00:35:35,723 --> 00:35:37,883
The Ami is the width of a car.

655
00:35:37,883 --> 00:35:40,563
It may be short,
but I've got this width issue.

656
00:35:40,563 --> 00:35:43,323
And that means
that while your little Citroen

657
00:35:43,323 --> 00:35:48,003
might be stuck in a slow crawl
towards Tom Hanks.

658
00:35:48,003 --> 00:35:51,923
in a Carver you could be bagging
a French Olympian...

659
00:35:51,923 --> 00:35:54,163
Teddy. SHUTTER CLICKS

660
00:35:54,163 --> 00:35:56,603
..and a former president.

661
00:35:56,603 --> 00:35:57,723
Charles de Gaulle.

662
00:35:57,723 --> 00:36:00,483
I'm going to put it there on his
shoulder on this one. Respect.

663
00:36:00,483 --> 00:36:01,883
SHUTTER CLICKS

664
00:36:03,403 --> 00:36:05,963
Here he is! Ryan Gosling!

665
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:08,483
La La Land, I'm in it.

666
00:36:08,483 --> 00:36:10,963
Oh, that's a handsome man.

667
00:36:11,963 --> 00:36:15,843
With just half an hour of our city
sprint left to go,

668
00:36:15,843 --> 00:36:20,003
me and my micro car
were finally on the board.

669
00:36:20,003 --> 00:36:21,123
Cheers, Ryan!

670
00:36:21,123 --> 00:36:25,043
But the breakdown had left
us way off the pace.

671
00:36:25,043 --> 00:36:26,683
Run, Forrest, run!

672
00:36:26,683 --> 00:36:28,203
SHUTTER CLICKS

673
00:36:28,203 --> 00:36:31,363
So while the other two
were still fighting for the win...

674
00:36:31,363 --> 00:36:33,883
Van Gogh! Ho-ho!

675
00:36:33,883 --> 00:36:35,883
I've got to give it a go with
Van Gogh, I think.

676
00:36:35,883 --> 00:36:37,963
..me and the Transformer were now

677
00:36:37,963 --> 00:36:42,163
only in reach of Harris's
celebrity leftovers.

678
00:36:42,163 --> 00:36:45,083
Oh, no, he's got a red beret on. No!

679
00:36:47,643 --> 00:36:49,603
There we go.
Desperate measures.

680
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:54,083
I'm going to go to the Eiffel Tower.

681
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:55,243
Where are you, Vincent?

682
00:36:57,643 --> 00:36:59,043
Where'd Van Gogh be, then?

683
00:37:00,563 --> 00:37:04,163
My only chance of winning
is getting there first on time

684
00:37:04,163 --> 00:37:06,003
and the lads get stuck.

685
00:37:06,003 --> 00:37:07,603
Oh, you're kidding me.

686
00:37:08,603 --> 00:37:10,243
It's got a hat on it already.

687
00:37:11,523 --> 00:37:14,043
Too late now, son. I've done you!

688
00:37:15,163 --> 00:37:18,683
I think with three, statistically,
I'm all right.

689
00:37:18,683 --> 00:37:20,443
On my way to the finishing line,

690
00:37:20,443 --> 00:37:23,563
but am I going to get
there on time?

691
00:37:23,563 --> 00:37:26,123
Cos if I don't I'll be gutted.

692
00:37:28,763 --> 00:37:30,323
Jeez, this thing shifts!

693
00:37:31,363 --> 00:37:33,683
Oh, I should have gone down there.

694
00:37:33,683 --> 00:37:35,363
Oh, sugar.
I should have gone down there.

695
00:37:35,363 --> 00:37:37,043
Right, I've gone wrong.

696
00:37:37,043 --> 00:37:38,243
There is the Eiffel Tower.

697
00:37:38,243 --> 00:37:39,963
Come on.

698
00:37:39,963 --> 00:37:42,483
Oh, I can see the chequered flag.

699
00:37:42,483 --> 00:37:44,883
I can see the chequered flag.

700
00:37:46,003 --> 00:37:47,963
Here we go.

701
00:37:47,963 --> 00:37:49,683
There's the finish line.

702
00:37:49,683 --> 00:37:51,403
HORN BLARES

703
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:53,763
Hey!

704
00:37:55,643 --> 00:37:57,523
I'm not seeing any other
vehicles yet.

705
00:37:57,523 --> 00:38:00,243
I'll get us a table
at the restaurant.

706
00:38:00,243 --> 00:38:02,883
Oh, they're both here.
Damn it.

707
00:38:02,883 --> 00:38:04,163
There he is.

708
00:38:06,483 --> 00:38:08,603
Here he is. Well done, Christles.
Lads.

709
00:38:08,603 --> 00:38:11,163
Bit tight on time. Bit tight
on time.  Cutting it fine.

710
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:14,243
Now, I think I did OK.
I don't think I've won.

711
00:38:14,243 --> 00:38:16,963
Right.  So I'll show you.
I'm out, Chris.  you're out?

712
00:38:16,963 --> 00:38:18,963
I got Ryan Gosling...
Yeah.  ..one...  Yeah.

713
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,483
..and I nicked your Marcel.

714
00:38:20,483 --> 00:38:22,923
I took your beret off and put mine
on. So you can have that one.

715
00:38:22,923 --> 00:38:25,283
This worries me cos that means that
- I would have thought,

716
00:38:25,283 --> 00:38:26,803
statistically, I got three...

717
00:38:28,203 --> 00:38:29,763
Oh, and he looks smug. OK.

718
00:38:29,763 --> 00:38:31,923
I do look a little bit smug.
That's Paddy McGuinness.

719
00:38:31,923 --> 00:38:33,323
how many did you get?  Cinq.

720
00:38:33,323 --> 00:38:35,403
Five! There we go.

721
00:38:35,403 --> 00:38:37,003
Creme brulee.

722
00:38:37,003 --> 00:38:39,163
Thank you.  Beaten into second place.
Thank you.

723
00:38:39,163 --> 00:38:40,563
Well done, Chris.

724
00:38:40,563 --> 00:38:43,043
I do like a treasure hunt, lads.
Can we do more of that?

725
00:38:43,043 --> 00:38:44,163
I enjoyed that.

726
00:38:44,163 --> 00:38:46,683
What we've got to do is get
them waxworks back in

727
00:38:46,683 --> 00:38:49,803
cos in this heat,
they'll be like a 99.

728
00:38:57,483 --> 00:38:59,483
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

729
00:39:05,683 --> 00:39:09,323
To sum up, if you want to dash
around Paris sticking berets

730
00:39:09,323 --> 00:39:13,043
on waxworks, the car for the job
is the Carver.  Correct.

731
00:39:13,043 --> 00:39:15,123
They'll be putting that in the
brochure.

732
00:39:15,123 --> 00:39:16,963
It's not surprising the Carver won

733
00:39:16,963 --> 00:39:19,923
because what this test has proved,
when it comes to squeezing

734
00:39:19,923 --> 00:39:22,563
through a city, and there's
never a good way to say

735
00:39:22,563 --> 00:39:25,723
this word, everyone,
it's all about girth.

736
00:39:25,723 --> 00:39:27,803
LAUGHTER

737
00:39:27,803 --> 00:39:30,843
What you need is something
a little bit slender.

738
00:39:30,843 --> 00:39:32,963
No, the Ami, that's great,

739
00:39:32,963 --> 00:39:34,803
but it's the same width
as a regular vehicle.

740
00:39:34,803 --> 00:39:36,883
You're stuck in the same
traffic as everyone else,

741
00:39:36,883 --> 00:39:38,523
but with no air con.  Yeah.

742
00:39:38,523 --> 00:39:40,923
And, Fred,
the City Transformer - again,

743
00:39:40,923 --> 00:39:44,683
great little car if only it'd
transform into something that works.

744
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:48,163
Yeah, well, the one I had in Paris
was a prototype, and they reckon now

745
00:39:48,163 --> 00:39:49,683
they've fixed the glitches.  Right.

746
00:39:49,683 --> 00:39:53,523
So it seems I was a very important
part of the development process.

747
00:39:53,523 --> 00:39:55,403
OK.  You're welcome.

748
00:39:55,403 --> 00:39:58,083
But for now, the Carver
is the clear winner.

749
00:39:58,083 --> 00:40:01,603
Not only is it the best around town,
but it turns every corner

750
00:40:01,603 --> 00:40:04,163
into an event. You're tilting
that way... It's fantastic.

751
00:40:04,163 --> 00:40:06,963
But they could make a couple of
slight improvements, couldn't they?

752
00:40:06,963 --> 00:40:09,043
Take the roof off it,
remove a wheel,

753
00:40:09,043 --> 00:40:10,923
they could call it a motorcycle.

754
00:40:12,483 --> 00:40:13,963
I think he's on to something.

755
00:40:13,963 --> 00:40:17,163
But now it's time to move on from
electric to very petrol

756
00:40:17,163 --> 00:40:20,123
as we get back
to our big supercar adventure.

757
00:40:27,323 --> 00:40:33,043
Our vital humanity-advancing quest
to discover what makes a truly great

758
00:40:33,043 --> 00:40:35,603
supercar had led us into Austria...

759
00:40:37,243 --> 00:40:40,763
..where, having now spent
a good spell behind the wheel,

760
00:40:40,763 --> 00:40:44,363
it has to be said,
over in the more expensive seats

761
00:40:44,363 --> 00:40:50,483
that new-car shine was just starting
to wear off in a couple of places.

762
00:40:54,763 --> 00:40:57,603
Do you know, there's so many things
with this car,

763
00:40:57,603 --> 00:40:58,843
it's so dramatic.

764
00:41:00,723 --> 00:41:03,803
It has a really annoying thing
where if you, say, pull up to

765
00:41:03,803 --> 00:41:08,563
a traffic light and you're sat there
for 30 seconds or so,

766
00:41:08,563 --> 00:41:12,243
it engages neutral automatically.

767
00:41:12,243 --> 00:41:15,643
And then when you put it in first
to set off, there's a little lag

768
00:41:15,643 --> 00:41:17,363
of about a second or so.

769
00:41:17,363 --> 00:41:20,323
But in that second,
the lights are on green,

770
00:41:20,323 --> 00:41:22,843
you've got some tool behind you.
beeping their horn,

771
00:41:22,843 --> 00:41:24,803
"Come on, mate. They're on green."

772
00:41:24,803 --> 00:41:26,963
I'm like, "I know, I'm just putting
it in first gear."

773
00:41:30,163 --> 00:41:32,283
I'm a Ferrari man.
I love them.

774
00:41:32,283 --> 00:41:34,883
I love the brand.
I love the heritage.

775
00:41:34,883 --> 00:41:38,643
But the thing which is getting
on my nerves a bit is all

776
00:41:38,643 --> 00:41:41,723
this touch stuff -
heating, fan, seat.

777
00:41:41,723 --> 00:41:43,923
Ugh. Display.

778
00:41:43,923 --> 00:41:45,523
It's all one touch pads.

779
00:41:45,523 --> 00:41:49,363
And half the time, I'm looking
down here trying to find stuff.

780
00:41:49,363 --> 00:41:51,403
I've got 800 horsepower.

781
00:41:51,403 --> 00:41:53,083
I need my eyes on the road.

782
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:56,083
I don't want to be looking
down around everywhere.

783
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:58,603
It's fixing problems for me
that don't exist.

784
00:42:02,803 --> 00:42:05,963
Lads, let's talk rarity.

785
00:42:05,963 --> 00:42:08,803
Firstly, how many of them Ferraris?

786
00:42:08,803 --> 00:42:11,443
Not sure. Probably about 10,000
they're going to make of them.

787
00:42:11,443 --> 00:42:14,243
It's going to be popular, isn't it?
What about yours, Chris?

788
00:42:14,243 --> 00:42:16,803
Fewer, I reckon.
5,000, 6,000 in all.

789
00:42:16,803 --> 00:42:18,603
Big numbers, lads.

790
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:21,643
The Pagani, 40.

791
00:42:21,643 --> 00:42:24,963
To put that into some
kind of context for you -

792
00:42:24,963 --> 00:42:27,523
there's been 45 US presidents.

793
00:42:27,523 --> 00:42:30,163
Who's told him this information?

794
00:42:30,163 --> 00:42:31,323
45 presidents.

795
00:42:32,403 --> 00:42:35,883
I reckon the people at Pagani would
be happy if there's still 40

796
00:42:35,883 --> 00:42:37,963
of them cars when you finish
today, Paddy.

797
00:42:40,123 --> 00:42:42,883
Well, it was time to
give them a scare.

798
00:42:47,243 --> 00:42:51,883
Because to help us out on our quest,
the producers had told us to stop

799
00:42:51,883 --> 00:42:53,763
off at a local test track.

800
00:42:56,683 --> 00:42:57,723
Wowsers.

801
00:42:58,723 --> 00:43:04,123
If I had to design a circuit that
was least suitable for a Huayra BC

802
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,443
this would be it.

803
00:43:07,443 --> 00:43:09,403
Best of luck, McGuinness.

804
00:43:09,403 --> 00:43:11,523
Here we go.
I'm going to stop here, lads.

805
00:43:11,523 --> 00:43:12,643
There's a fella.

806
00:43:12,643 --> 00:43:16,923
The idea was we'd each stick
on a heart rate monitor,

807
00:43:16,923 --> 00:43:19,003
do a couple of laps
in all three cars...

808
00:43:19,003 --> 00:43:20,043
Danke.

809
00:43:20,043 --> 00:43:23,243
..and whichever caused our heart
rates to spike the highest

810
00:43:23,243 --> 00:43:25,203
would be the most exciting.

811
00:43:26,683 --> 00:43:29,123
Not a bad way to help
decide which supercar gives

812
00:43:29,123 --> 00:43:31,523
you the more thrills.

813
00:43:31,523 --> 00:43:36,083
The only question for the Pagani was
what kind of excitement it'd be.

814
00:43:36,083 --> 00:43:37,603
What do you reckon, boys? Shall we?

815
00:43:37,603 --> 00:43:38,963
Here we go.

816
00:43:41,363 --> 00:43:43,203
ENGINES REV

817
00:43:47,323 --> 00:43:48,363
And we're off.

818
00:43:51,443 --> 00:43:53,003
Come on, McGuinness!

819
00:43:53,003 --> 00:43:55,883
These hypercars are all well and
good until you've got

820
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,123
a narrow circuit.

821
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:00,243
Whoa!  Now watch him go.

822
00:44:02,083 --> 00:44:04,123
Oh-ho-ho! It's gone!

823
00:44:05,483 --> 00:44:06,523
Oh, my God.

824
00:44:06,523 --> 00:44:07,563
BLEEP, BLEEP.

825
00:44:09,643 --> 00:44:11,363
Look at the speed of it!

826
00:44:13,003 --> 00:44:16,203
I put it in track mode and then
I pressed the qualifying button,

827
00:44:16,203 --> 00:44:21,563
which gives me all of the
818 horsepower.

828
00:44:21,563 --> 00:44:24,883
Not recharging the batteries,
nothing.

829
00:44:24,883 --> 00:44:26,643
Just going.

830
00:44:27,763 --> 00:44:32,003
Wow, this thing is bonkers.

831
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:34,603
TYRES SCREECH

832
00:44:34,603 --> 00:44:36,963
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!

833
00:44:36,963 --> 00:44:38,763
There she goes.

834
00:44:38,763 --> 00:44:40,283
CHRIS LAUGHS

835
00:44:41,843 --> 00:44:44,443
Holy Scheisse.

836
00:44:44,443 --> 00:44:48,963
Paddy McGuinness's sphincter
is working overtime in that thing.

837
00:44:53,603 --> 00:44:55,323
Look at the little fella here.

838
00:44:55,323 --> 00:44:57,243
Let's let him have a bit of fun.

839
00:44:57,243 --> 00:44:58,723
Go on, Chris.

840
00:44:58,723 --> 00:45:00,483
Go on.

841
00:45:00,483 --> 00:45:02,203
Ha-ha!

842
00:45:02,203 --> 00:45:03,883
I must catch Flintoff.

843
00:45:08,883 --> 00:45:10,763
TYRES SCREECH

844
00:45:10,763 --> 00:45:12,963
Go on, Chrissy!

845
00:45:12,963 --> 00:45:14,923
He is definitely having fun.

846
00:45:19,403 --> 00:45:22,443
The balance of this car is
just sensational.

847
00:45:28,883 --> 00:45:31,403
Chris is catching me
in the little Porsche.

848
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:34,803
Here we go, Chris.

849
00:45:34,803 --> 00:45:36,523
Don't even think about it.

850
00:45:37,803 --> 00:45:39,083
Look at it go!

851
00:45:44,403 --> 00:45:46,683
Pull away. Get away! Get away!

852
00:45:47,803 --> 00:45:49,403
Oh, I'm in love!

853
00:45:49,403 --> 00:45:51,523
That Ferrari has got some legs.

854
00:45:53,803 --> 00:45:57,083
First run results were in,
and predictably enough showed

855
00:45:57,083 --> 00:46:01,923
that Flintoff is basically a basking
shark, and the Pagani really does

856
00:46:01,923 --> 00:46:04,443
get the blood pumping.

857
00:46:04,443 --> 00:46:05,763
Time to swap cars...

858
00:46:07,763 --> 00:46:08,803
..and run again.

859
00:46:15,043 --> 00:46:16,803
Wow.

860
00:46:16,803 --> 00:46:19,163
OK. That's just silly.

861
00:46:19,163 --> 00:46:21,843
That's so much faster
than the Porsche.

862
00:46:25,683 --> 00:46:27,723
Oh, my word. Wow!

863
00:46:28,883 --> 00:46:30,883
This is raw. It's visceral.

864
00:46:33,043 --> 00:46:34,083
Come on.

865
00:46:38,883 --> 00:46:41,163
Man alive!

866
00:46:41,163 --> 00:46:44,003
Really interesting getting straight
out of the Porsche into this.

867
00:46:44,003 --> 00:46:45,443
That thing just feels alive.

868
00:46:45,443 --> 00:46:47,403
The steering's wriggling around
in your hand.

869
00:46:47,403 --> 00:46:50,403
In this thing it's a numb device
compared to the Porsche.

870
00:46:54,323 --> 00:46:57,523
I've never driven anything
like this in my life.

871
00:47:00,603 --> 00:47:02,843
I like it. I don't like it.

872
00:47:02,843 --> 00:47:05,203
I'm enjoying it.
I'm scared of it.

873
00:47:05,203 --> 00:47:07,483
I don't really know what's
going on with his car.

874
00:47:09,163 --> 00:47:11,843
Here we go, I put the windscreen
wipers on then and I don't even know

875
00:47:11,843 --> 00:47:13,923
how I did it.

876
00:47:13,923 --> 00:47:16,723
I tell you what, though,
it's something else to drive.

877
00:47:19,843 --> 00:47:21,443
Oh, man!

878
00:47:24,043 --> 00:47:26,683
I think I might be having fun.

879
00:47:26,683 --> 00:47:29,203
ENGINE REVS, TYRES SCREECH

880
00:47:30,683 --> 00:47:31,843
Jeepers creepers!

881
00:47:31,843 --> 00:47:35,883
I tell you what, with all the
traction off this is lively.

882
00:47:37,843 --> 00:47:40,243
This is a really impressive car.

883
00:47:40,243 --> 00:47:41,763
Really impressive.

884
00:47:49,603 --> 00:47:53,243
Impressive enough, it turned out,
to spike Harris's heart rate

885
00:47:53,243 --> 00:47:56,683
by more than 40 beats
over the Porsche.

886
00:47:56,683 --> 00:47:58,603
Wow, wow, wow.

887
00:47:58,603 --> 00:48:02,043
Mr Flintoff, you chose wisely.

888
00:48:02,043 --> 00:48:03,483
Deary me.

889
00:48:03,483 --> 00:48:07,723
And whilst the Cayman had calmed
me down and the Pagani had almost

890
00:48:07,723 --> 00:48:11,883
woken Fred up, there was now
just the small matter

891
00:48:11,883 --> 00:48:13,723
of one more swamp.

892
00:48:24,923 --> 00:48:27,243
Oh, my God.

893
00:48:27,243 --> 00:48:29,843
That is ridiculous.

894
00:48:32,883 --> 00:48:39,243
I've just got out of two cars with
800 horsepower into one with 500.

895
00:48:39,243 --> 00:48:41,363
It's a completely different drive.

896
00:48:43,483 --> 00:48:47,203
That does not mean, though,
it's not a hell of a lot of fun.

897
00:48:52,283 --> 00:48:53,323
Wow.

898
00:48:54,363 --> 00:48:55,603
Wow.

899
00:48:55,603 --> 00:48:56,643
Oh-ho-ho.

900
00:48:57,723 --> 00:48:59,883
Yeah, I've missed the point
a bit it here, haven't I?

901
00:48:59,883 --> 00:49:01,723
This isn't about how fast it goes

902
00:49:01,723 --> 00:49:03,283
but about the event.

903
00:49:05,803 --> 00:49:06,843
Ho-ho-ho!

904
00:49:08,123 --> 00:49:10,923
There he goes.
Look at Harris go in the Pagani.

905
00:49:14,963 --> 00:49:17,083
Hello, Pagani, my old friend.

906
00:49:19,643 --> 00:49:21,003
Bit sideways there.

907
00:49:23,363 --> 00:49:24,683
I love this Porsche.

908
00:49:24,683 --> 00:49:26,323
I understand it now,
Chrissy Harris.

909
00:49:26,323 --> 00:49:28,763
I understand the Porsche.

910
00:49:28,763 --> 00:49:31,483
Amazing. I'm in a full hypercar,

911
00:49:31,483 --> 00:49:33,803
and it really isn't much quicker
in a straight line

912
00:49:33,803 --> 00:49:35,403
than the baby Ferrari.

913
00:49:40,723 --> 00:49:42,763
Half the price of the Ferrari.

914
00:49:42,763 --> 00:49:46,043
5% of the price of the Pagani.

915
00:49:47,683 --> 00:49:50,043
I've got to say,
it's so much fun.

916
00:49:51,283 --> 00:49:54,523
Maybe just a bit too much fun.

917
00:49:54,523 --> 00:49:56,723
Here we go.
Let's give it some now.

918
00:50:07,643 --> 00:50:09,403
That was pretty special.

919
00:50:16,483 --> 00:50:19,083
We're missing a cricket player.
Oh, dear.

920
00:50:19,083 --> 00:50:23,083
Oh, this is the...
This is the drive of shame.

921
00:50:23,083 --> 00:50:24,643
Here he is.  What's happened?

922
00:50:24,643 --> 00:50:27,203
Nothing. He was just
enjoying himself.

923
00:50:28,403 --> 00:50:30,523
Everything OK?
Yeah.

924
00:50:30,523 --> 00:50:32,603
Just a bit of off-roading,
you know what I mean?

925
00:50:32,603 --> 00:50:34,603
I can see all that grass there.
What did you do?

926
00:50:34,603 --> 00:50:36,563
Well, I came round,
it started going sideways,

927
00:50:36,563 --> 00:50:38,843
I didn't catch it,
so I slid down the bank.

928
00:50:38,843 --> 00:50:41,683
You've actually come down the bank?
Yeah. And I just carried on again.

929
00:50:41,683 --> 00:50:43,803
Oh, that's nice.  I had another
go at it.  Right, so...

930
00:50:43,803 --> 00:50:47,003
Oh, 99. Gone down.

931
00:50:47,003 --> 00:50:48,563
130.

932
00:50:48,563 --> 00:50:49,963
130?

933
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:51,723
Is that less than that?

934
00:50:51,723 --> 00:50:53,363
It was less than that, yes.

935
00:50:53,363 --> 00:50:55,323
I wasn't confident enough to slide
that around.

936
00:50:55,323 --> 00:50:58,123
But still, it's an event. And I've
also got McGuinness in front of me,

937
00:50:58,123 --> 00:51:00,563
which is always going to make me
nervous.  What was yours?  77.

938
00:51:00,563 --> 00:51:04,123
Oh, that's not even alive!  What,
even after all that?  As I came down
the bank.  Yeah.  Yeah.

939
00:51:04,123 --> 00:51:05,683
..I got to 115.  Nice.

940
00:51:05,683 --> 00:51:08,323
..and then I got back to the bank
and I was back to 75.

941
00:51:08,323 --> 00:51:10,603
So do you always get nervous
when you off road?

942
00:51:10,603 --> 00:51:12,763
When it's off-road unintentionally.

943
00:51:12,763 --> 00:51:17,283
So clearly, Pagani's the winner
because everyone's heart rate
went up.

944
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:19,243
No, I was highest in that, 147.

945
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:22,123
Yeah, and you were lowest in that.  I
was lowest in that having more fun.

946
00:51:22,123 --> 00:51:23,923
Hang on, I'm just trying to
compute this.

947
00:51:23,923 --> 00:51:27,203
I'm enjoying myself at my most
when I'm calm...  Yeah.

948
00:51:27,203 --> 00:51:29,683
..and I'm in it
and I'm just relaxed.

949
00:51:29,683 --> 00:51:31,363
I was that in the Porsche.

950
00:51:31,363 --> 00:51:33,163
What I rate more fun for me.

951
00:51:33,163 --> 00:51:37,083
Hang on, so your heart rate goes
up when you're not having fun

952
00:51:37,083 --> 00:51:39,323
and when you're really happy
and having fun,

953
00:51:39,323 --> 00:51:42,283
your heart rate goes down.
I'm calm. I'm calm. Yeah.

954
00:51:42,283 --> 00:51:43,643
Oh.

955
00:51:43,643 --> 00:51:44,763
Danke.

956
00:51:44,763 --> 00:51:46,403
Bit harsh.

957
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:49,883
You will now head to the
Grossglockner Pass,

958
00:51:49,883 --> 00:51:52,483
one of the greatest driving
roads in the world.

959
00:51:52,483 --> 00:51:56,243
Please decide between you
who is taking which car.

960
00:51:56,243 --> 00:51:59,283
Can I first of all say, I don't want
to go in that?  I'm with you.

961
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:01,923
I don't want either of you to go in
that because that's what

962
00:52:01,923 --> 00:52:04,203
I'm going in. Love it.

963
00:52:04,203 --> 00:52:05,803
Erm...

964
00:52:05,803 --> 00:52:07,923
Never thought I'd say it,
but do you fancy swapping?

965
00:52:07,923 --> 00:52:08,963
Yes, please.

966
00:52:10,803 --> 00:52:13,923
Now, look, when you're given the
chance to drive

967
00:52:13,923 --> 00:52:16,723
a £3.2 million Pagani,

968
00:52:16,723 --> 00:52:20,403
however intense, maybe even
sometimes stressful

969
00:52:20,403 --> 00:52:22,563
that experience might be,

970
00:52:22,563 --> 00:52:27,243
the thing is, you always know
that soon enough, you're going to

971
00:52:27,243 --> 00:52:29,323
have to give it back.

972
00:52:29,323 --> 00:52:32,803
And having been lucky enough
to spend some time with one,

973
00:52:32,803 --> 00:52:38,803
I was going to make the most
of every last minute.

974
00:52:41,563 --> 00:52:44,803
I knew those two would swap.
Car buddies.

975
00:52:44,803 --> 00:52:47,003
But, I'm glad.

976
00:52:48,403 --> 00:52:51,323
I really love this car.

977
00:52:52,443 --> 00:52:54,963
I love the theatre.
I love the drama.

978
00:52:56,043 --> 00:52:57,803
I love everything about it.

979
00:53:00,483 --> 00:53:05,083
Quite clear that Fred really enjoyed
the GT4 RS, as did I.

980
00:53:06,603 --> 00:53:08,483
The fact that Fred enjoyed it,
I just thought,

981
00:53:08,483 --> 00:53:09,683
share the wealth, Chris.

982
00:53:09,683 --> 00:53:11,323
Share the wealth.

983
00:53:13,003 --> 00:53:16,803
I've chosen to drive this
sensational 800-horsepower Ferrari

984
00:53:16,803 --> 00:53:18,843
through altruism alone.

985
00:53:18,843 --> 00:53:20,563
I'm just being generous.

986
00:53:22,923 --> 00:53:25,883
The Ferrari's rapid,
it's comfortable, it's beautiful.

987
00:53:27,603 --> 00:53:29,883
But this was the one.

988
00:53:29,883 --> 00:53:34,923
Giving up the new Ferrari
for a Porsche half the price.

989
00:53:36,563 --> 00:53:39,563
And do you know what?
That suits me just fine.

990
00:53:43,203 --> 00:53:45,883
Here we go, lads, the Grossglockner.

991
00:53:45,883 --> 00:53:48,083
Genuinely excited by this.

992
00:53:48,083 --> 00:53:49,963
My heart rate might touch 80!

993
00:53:49,963 --> 00:53:52,563
MUSIC: Outro
by M83

994
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:59,843
36 hairpin bends draped across
48km of pristine tarmac.

995
00:53:59,843 --> 00:54:03,803
Winding through the heart of one
of the most stunning landscapes

996
00:54:03,803 --> 00:54:05,123
in central Europe.

997
00:54:06,283 --> 00:54:10,723
The Grossglockner Pass isn't just
the highest road in Austria.

998
00:54:10,723 --> 00:54:15,403
It's one of the most awe-inspiring
drives anywhere on the planet.

999
00:54:16,883 --> 00:54:23,443
And in an open top Pagani, it can
also be one of the most refreshing.

1000
00:54:23,443 --> 00:54:24,643
Oh, dear.

1001
00:54:28,083 --> 00:54:31,803
Should have give the man with
a van a call. Whack my roof on.

1002
00:54:31,803 --> 00:54:36,283
I'm not sure this is Huayra BC
Roadster conditions now.

1003
00:54:38,403 --> 00:54:40,443
You'd be absolutely correct.

1004
00:54:47,083 --> 00:54:50,723
This car is outrageous.

1005
00:54:50,723 --> 00:54:54,683
So much torque.
I'm in third gear on a hairpin,

1006
00:54:54,683 --> 00:54:57,123
and the traction control's
coming in.

1007
00:54:57,123 --> 00:54:58,163
Wow.

1008
00:55:00,643 --> 00:55:02,483
This is incredible.

1009
00:55:02,483 --> 00:55:03,963
What a road this is.

1010
00:55:03,963 --> 00:55:06,083
ENGINE REVS

1011
00:55:06,083 --> 00:55:07,483
This is the car.

1012
00:55:07,483 --> 00:55:09,563
This is the car for this road.

1013
00:55:11,963 --> 00:55:16,283
As we climbed higher,
the clouds began to part.

1014
00:55:16,283 --> 00:55:21,563
The supercar gods were smiling,
and Paddy and his Pagani came back

1015
00:55:21,563 --> 00:55:23,363
to the party.

1016
00:55:23,363 --> 00:55:25,923
Oh, this is good.

1017
00:55:25,923 --> 00:55:27,723
# Now and forever... #

1018
00:55:27,723 --> 00:55:29,323
What a road.

1019
00:55:29,323 --> 00:55:32,683
# I'm your king. #

1020
00:55:32,683 --> 00:55:34,483
Whoo-ho-ho!

1021
00:55:38,883 --> 00:55:41,883
Wow. What a piece of tarmac, boys.

1022
00:55:43,203 --> 00:55:46,963
Wow. Look at that view.

1023
00:55:46,963 --> 00:55:49,043
What a treat this has been.

1024
00:55:52,483 --> 00:55:54,883
The cars, the roads, the scenery.

1025
00:55:57,323 --> 00:55:58,723
Amazing.

1026
00:56:01,803 --> 00:56:04,283
I think we're near the top, boys.
I think we're near the top.

1027
00:56:10,683 --> 00:56:12,963
That's the summit.

1028
00:56:12,963 --> 00:56:14,203
Oh!

1029
00:56:30,083 --> 00:56:32,763
First things first.
Is your handbrake on?

1030
00:56:32,763 --> 00:56:34,563
Yes.
Is your handbrake on?

1031
00:56:34,563 --> 00:56:36,843
The handbrakes are on.
Everything's on.

1032
00:56:36,843 --> 00:56:38,683
Wow.  Unbelievable.

1033
00:56:38,683 --> 00:56:41,523
Never driven anything like it.

1034
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:43,003
Look at that.

1035
00:56:43,003 --> 00:56:45,123
That is sensational.

1036
00:56:46,163 --> 00:56:51,203
Autobahn, racetrack, Grossglockner.
Magic.

1037
00:56:51,203 --> 00:56:52,523
What a trip.

1038
00:56:57,043 --> 00:56:58,723
Same cars on the way down, boys?

1039
00:56:58,723 --> 00:57:00,163
Yes, please.

1040
00:57:01,323 --> 00:57:04,323
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

1041
00:57:04,323 --> 00:57:06,363
You still think it's yours!

1042
00:57:07,803 --> 00:57:09,403
No.

1043
00:57:09,403 --> 00:57:13,763
Now, we have to reach some
conclusions here, lads.

1044
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:18,203
Now remember, we set out to find out
how these cars made us feel.

1045
00:57:18,203 --> 00:57:21,323
Paddy, did you enjoy driving
your Pagani?

1046
00:57:21,323 --> 00:57:24,603
Well, don't get me wrong,
I love this car, love it,

1047
00:57:24,603 --> 00:57:27,803
and it had the power to make
Ferraris invisible.  I agree, yeah.

1048
00:57:27,803 --> 00:57:29,923
And every time I got out of it,
I was in a good mood.

1049
00:57:29,923 --> 00:57:31,803
So did you enjoy it?

1050
00:57:31,803 --> 00:57:35,563
Well, I was in a good mood
cos I'd survived.

1051
00:57:35,563 --> 00:57:39,323
I was just happy all my body parts
were where they should be, really.

1052
00:57:39,323 --> 00:57:41,403
It was not so much happy,
more relief.

1053
00:57:41,403 --> 00:57:43,043
It was a happy ending.

1054
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:44,603
LAUGHTER

1055
00:57:44,603 --> 00:57:46,763
Don't go there. Don't go there.

1056
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:48,123
Fred.  Yeah?

1057
00:57:48,123 --> 00:57:50,283
It's important we talk
about our feelings.  Mm.

1058
00:57:50,283 --> 00:57:53,603
How did that Ferrari make you feel?

1059
00:57:53,603 --> 00:57:55,123
That's the question, isn't it?

1060
00:57:55,123 --> 00:57:59,083
It's so fast, but also
a bit sterile.  Mm.  All right?

1061
00:57:59,083 --> 00:58:02,763
And it's about, not the speed,
like you say, how it made us feel.

1062
00:58:02,763 --> 00:58:05,683
And I can't believe I'm saying
this about a Ferrari.

1063
00:58:05,683 --> 00:58:07,603
I didn't feel much.
I felt a little bit numb.

1064
00:58:07,603 --> 00:58:12,163
But that Porsche -
punching way above its weight.

1065
00:58:12,163 --> 00:58:15,243
Just a fantastic car, isn't it?
I just loved every minute of it.

1066
00:58:15,243 --> 00:58:17,843
And each time you both drove it,
you got out smiling.

1067
00:58:17,843 --> 00:58:18,963
I loved it.

1068
00:58:18,963 --> 00:58:21,963
So obviously you two
are going for the Porsche.

1069
00:58:21,963 --> 00:58:23,363
We know that.  Yep.

1070
00:58:23,363 --> 00:58:26,123
But if I had to pick one
as a daily...

1071
00:58:26,123 --> 00:58:27,723
Yeah.

1072
00:58:27,723 --> 00:58:29,443
..it'd be the Porsche as well.

1073
00:58:29,443 --> 00:58:30,523
It really would.

1074
00:58:30,523 --> 00:58:33,283
But I tell you what, I'd save
the Pagani for little weekends

1075
00:58:33,283 --> 00:58:34,763
out round Morecambe.

1076
00:58:34,763 --> 00:58:36,803
Love that.  Morecambe?
Love that, yes.

1077
00:58:36,803 --> 00:58:40,163
So all in all,
a very successful research trip.

1078
00:58:40,163 --> 00:58:42,483
Absolutely.
And that's it for tonight.

1079
00:58:42,483 --> 00:58:46,923
But we've not done with the exotic
metal because in next week's show,

1080
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:51,323
Chris Harris has a go in Mercedes'
F1 car for the road, and trust me...

1081
00:58:51,323 --> 00:58:53,443
AUDIENCE CHEERS

1082
00:58:53,443 --> 00:58:55,203
..you do not want to miss that.

1083
00:58:55,203 --> 00:58:57,643
Thanks for watching.
See you, then. Goodnight!
