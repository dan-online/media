That can't be true. That's impossible.

180
00:11:13,963 --> 00:11:17,129
Impossible or not,
these creatures keep moving

181
00:11:17,213 --> 00:11:20,046
after we cut them up or shoot them down.

182
00:11:22,254 --> 00:11:23,838
Call for reinforcements.

183
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,171
[rapid beeping]

184
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,672
[sighs] There's no signal.

185
00:11:30,755 --> 00:11:32,546
We must be too deep underground.

186
00:11:33,338 --> 00:11:36,922
You two, head back to the surface
and contact General Mundi.

187
00:11:37,004 --> 00:11:38,880
Tell him we need reinforcements.

188
00:11:38,963 --> 00:11:39,963
Yes, sir.

189
00:11:41,546 --> 00:11:44,463
I won't be unhappy to get out
from under all this dirt.

190
00:11:45,963 --> 00:11:47,880
This place gives me the shivers.

191
00:11:50,088 --> 00:11:51,463
[low growl]

192
00:11:55,088 --> 00:11:57,880
Wind's probably playing tricks
on us, right?

193
00:11:57,963 --> 00:12:00,672
-Look around. There's nothing...
-[zombie shrieks]

194
00:12:00,755 --> 00:12:02,338
What the?

195
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:03,630
Blast 'em!

196
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,421
They're not going down!
We have to turn back!

197
00:12:10,588 --> 00:12:11,922
[screeching]

198
00:12:12,046 --> 00:12:13,880

199
00:12:15,004 --> 00:12:15,963
Gearshift!

200
00:12:16,755 --> 00:12:19,171
[screaming]

201
00:12:36,463 --> 00:12:39,505
Obviously this thing is a lot more
powerful than we assumed.

202
00:12:39,588 --> 00:12:42,254
I'm going to the surface
to alert General Mundi myself.

203
00:12:42,338 --> 00:12:44,880
I think that would be
a foolhardy move, Anakin.

204
00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:47,296
We can't divide our troops again.

205
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,838
We don't have time
to double back to the surface.

206
00:12:49,922 --> 00:12:53,338
Every moment we waste
puts Luminara in greater danger.

207
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,546
[wet slurping]

208
00:13:09,171 --> 00:13:12,004
[loud screeching]

209
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:28,713
The air is warmer here.

210
00:13:28,797 --> 00:13:30,213
We must be getting close.

211
00:13:30,296 --> 00:13:33,129
Oh, forget the heat. [coughs]

212
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:34,463
It smells down here.

213
00:13:34,546 --> 00:13:36,088
Keep your voice down.

214
00:13:36,171 --> 00:13:40,213
I'm just saying, this planet
is rotten from the inside out.

215
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,922
I've got a bad feeling about this.

216
00:13:49,004 --> 00:13:51,797
It must be the queen.

217
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,254
Any sign of Luminara?

218
00:13:53,338 --> 00:13:55,880
[Cody] I see her.
She's suspended near the throne.

219
00:13:55,963 --> 00:13:56,963
Perfect.

220
00:13:57,046 --> 00:13:58,338
What about Poggle?

221
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,588
He's speaking with the queen.

222
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:03,129
Good. You take the soldiers.

223
00:14:03,213 --> 00:14:04,880
I'll take the queen.

224
00:14:04,963 --> 00:14:07,338
Must you always rush into things?

225
00:14:07,421 --> 00:14:11,213
Oh, no, you don't actually
want to talk to it, do you?

226
00:14:11,296 --> 00:14:12,505
Matter of fact, I do.

227
00:14:12,588 --> 00:14:15,922
Anakin, don't you wonder
why they took Luminara captive?

228
00:14:16,004 --> 00:14:17,171
Why not just kill her?

229
00:14:17,254 --> 00:14:19,338
She's leverage. She's a hostage.

230
00:14:19,421 --> 00:14:20,672
Leverage for what?

231
00:14:20,755 --> 00:14:22,755
No, there's something else going on here,

232
00:14:22,838 --> 00:14:24,713
and these zombies are connected to it.

233
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:27,004
Fine. We'll try it your way.

234
00:14:27,088 --> 00:14:28,588
So glad you agree.

235
00:14:28,672 --> 00:14:30,672
Cody, set your men up
around the perimeter.

236
00:14:30,755 --> 00:14:32,338
These creatures live in darkness.

237
00:14:32,421 --> 00:14:35,129
The light from your helmet
should blind them temporarily.

238
00:14:35,213 --> 00:14:36,713
Turn your lamps on at my signal.

239
00:14:36,797 --> 00:14:39,880
They should create enough confusion
for us to get Luminara out of here.

240
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,630
But what happens when the bugs pursue?

241
00:14:41,713 --> 00:14:43,254
You've seen them in action, sir.

242
00:14:43,338 --> 00:14:45,588
We can't kill them.
We'll have to bury them.

243
00:14:45,672 --> 00:14:47,046
It'll at least slow them down.

244
00:14:47,129 --> 00:14:50,296
Shoot out the support pillars
and this whole place will collapse.

245
00:14:50,421 --> 00:14:51,421
Let's go.

246
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:09,129
[growling and snarling]

247
00:15:12,838 --> 00:15:14,755
[screeches loudly]

248
00:15:15,296 --> 00:15:17,838
How did you know
they wouldn't just attack us?

249
00:15:17,922 --> 00:15:19,838
[zombies gurgling]

250
00:15:19,922 --> 00:15:24,088
Because I make observations
while you think with your lightsaber.

251
00:15:30,505 --> 00:15:33,129
Well, that quick thinking of mine
is usually needed

252
00:15:33,213 --> 00:15:35,213
when your observations
get us into trouble.

253
00:15:35,296 --> 00:15:37,296
Anakin, the queen took Luminara hostage.

254
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,922
She wanted a Jedi. Now she has two more.

255
00:15:40,004 --> 00:15:41,838
I want to know what she's after.

256
00:15:41,922 --> 00:15:44,838
[zombies screeching]

257
00:15:44,922 --> 00:15:48,672
Well, when this doesn't go as planned,
which it won't, I'll be ready.

258
00:15:48,755 --> 00:15:50,963
That is so reassuring.

259
00:15:51,797 --> 00:15:53,922
[croaks]

260
00:15:54,004 --> 00:15:57,755
I thought I told you
not to follow me, Master Kenobi.

261
00:15:57,838 --> 00:16:00,004
Yes, well, I took a lesson from Anakin

262
00:16:00,088 --> 00:16:02,380
and decided not to follow orders.

263
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:03,630
Hey.

264
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,755
You.

265
00:16:05,838 --> 00:16:08,004
You...

266
00:16:08,088 --> 00:16:13,797
are the creatures that attacked Geonosia.

267
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,254
Why have you...

268
00:16:17,338 --> 00:16:21,254
come before me?

269
00:16:21,338 --> 00:16:25,254
Your Majesty, it is a pleasure
to finally meet you.

270
00:16:25,338 --> 00:16:28,713
I am Obi-Wan Kenobi,
and this is Anakin Skywalker.

271
00:16:28,797 --> 00:16:32,922
It is our sad duty to inform you
that your rule is at an end.

272
00:16:33,505 --> 00:16:37,797
You not dictate

273
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,171
to me, Jedi.

274
00:16:41,254 --> 00:16:46,380
My empire is forever.

275
00:16:48,463 --> 00:16:51,546
I'm afraid it does not appear
that way, your grace.

276
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:56,088
You shall release the Jedi Luminara
and submit to Republic law.

277
00:16:56,171 --> 00:16:58,922
[growling]

278
00:16:59,004 --> 00:17:03,380
[screeching]

279
00:17:04,797 --> 00:17:08,296
I no submit

280
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,838
to you!

281
00:17:12,421 --> 00:17:15,213
No, patience, Anakin. Wait.

282
00:17:17,797 --> 00:17:21,046
Majesty, destroying us shall only make

283
00:17:21,129 --> 00:17:23,755
the Republic's judgment of you harsher.

284
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:25,922
[groans]

285
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:28,421
No, Jedi.

286
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,046
No!

287
00:17:30,129 --> 00:17:34,338
I no destroy you.

288
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:39,213
I devour you.

289
00:17:39,296 --> 00:17:42,421
I control you.

290
00:17:42,505 --> 00:17:45,922
I had but one Jedi

291
00:17:46,046 --> 00:17:50,129
before young Poggle bring me.

292
00:17:50,213 --> 00:17:52,421
But now

293
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:56,880
I have three.

294
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:02,380
Now, watch as my child

295
00:18:02,463 --> 00:18:07,046
enters your Jedi friend.

296
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:10,129
And once inside,

297
00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:12,755
her mind

298
00:18:12,838 --> 00:18:16,171
becomes my mind.

299
00:18:16,254 --> 00:18:21,296
Her thoughts, my thoughts.

300
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,672
It's a sort of mind control, a hive mind.

301
00:18:23,755 --> 00:18:24,963
She thinks she can possess us.

302
00:18:25,046 --> 00:18:27,338
Great. Find out everything
you wanted to know yet?

303
00:18:27,421 --> 00:18:29,254
No, wait. I want to see how it works.

304
00:18:29,338 --> 00:18:31,588
I don't think Luminara
wants to see how it works.

305
00:18:31,672 --> 00:18:33,546
No, I don't.

306
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,755
I'm curious.
The more we know, the better.

307
00:18:37,463 --> 00:18:38,838
I disagree.

308
00:18:38,922 --> 00:18:40,421
-So do I.
-Come now.

309
00:18:40,505 --> 00:18:42,171
The nose or the ear,
which do you think it will enter?

310
00:18:45,046 --> 00:18:46,421
[sighs] I think the nose.

311
00:18:46,505 --> 00:18:48,880
Uh, I hope this is part of the plan.

312
00:18:49,672 --> 00:18:51,004
Isn't it always?

313
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,254

Wha... Anakin, no!

321
00:19:28,046 --> 00:19:29,463
Got it.

322
00:19:29,546 --> 00:19:31,672
What are you doing?
I was going to study that.

323
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:33,296

324
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,880
Come on, let's get out of here.

325
00:19:34,963 --> 00:19:35,963
Here they come.

326
00:19:41,838 --> 00:19:43,004
Take out the supports!

This is our way out.

332
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:23,338

[coughs] That went better than I expected.

I wish we could have gotten
one of those worms.

342
00:21:46,213 --> 00:21:49,922
Knowing how the queen controls
her minions could have proven valuable.

343
00:21:50,004 --> 00:21:53,171
Well, hopefully the secret
is buried with her.
