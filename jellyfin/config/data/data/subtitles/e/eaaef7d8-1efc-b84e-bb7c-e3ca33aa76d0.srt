1
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:27,250
<i>Yes?</i>

2
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:29,958
I'll be right there. Don't move.

3
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:50,000
<i>Imagine a world</i>
<i>where information can't be trusted.</i>

4
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:53,833
<i>Not very hard, is it?</i>

5
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:56,917
<i>News service says one thing,</i>

6
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,375
<i>website says another.</i>

7
00:01:01,792 --> 00:01:04,167
<i>Society starts to fray.</i>

8
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,917
<i>All we can turn to</i>
<i>are the people we care about.</i>

9
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:13,375
<i>But what if those people</i>
<i>weren't who we thought they were?</i>

10
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,375
<i>What if the ones closest to us,</i>

11
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,542
<i>the ones we've trusted our whole lives...</i>

12
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,542
<i>...were someone else entirely?</i>

13
00:01:29,542 --> 00:01:31,875
<i>What if they weren't even human?</i>

14
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:41,542
Agent Prescod, respectfully...

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,167
uh, what exactly are you talking about?

16
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:47,042
Chaos.

17
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,042
And that's only the beginning.

18
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:54,083
Five global terrorist strikes
within the past year.

19
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:56,417
Each one claimed by a different group.

20
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,125
It's business as usual.

21
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:01,208
That's precisely
what they want you to think.

22
00:02:01,292 --> 00:02:06,167
Argentina attacks Colombia,
Colombia attacks the Philippines.

23
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,500
A violent chain reaction
consuming the globe.

24
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:11,667
Do you realize
that the entire world is at war?

25
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,167
Well, the atmosphere has been tense.

26
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:17,167
There is an architect to that tension,
Agent Ross.

27
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,208
These attacks are escalating.

28
00:02:19,292 --> 00:02:22,083
If they hit the soil
of the major power... Oh.

29
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:25,917
So you... You think the same people
are behind all of this?

30
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:27,917
Not people...

31
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:31,208
Skrulls.

32
00:02:33,917 --> 00:02:36,333
Come on, Ross, you know the stories.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,625
This didn't start yesterday.

34
00:02:38,708 --> 00:02:41,417
It started 30 years ago
when the Skrulls found Earth.

35
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:46,125
Carol Danvers and Nick Fury
promised to find them a new planet.

36
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:48,167
But now...

37
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,042
now they don't want just any planet,
they want ours.

38
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:54,458
Look, can't you see it?

39
00:02:55,417 --> 00:02:58,292
All these groups, they're the same.

40
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:01,417
Skrulls could be anybody,
anywhere, at any time.

41
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,875
And there is only a tiny handful
known to live on Earth.

42
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:07,708
- That's barely enough to...
- To what?

43
00:03:07,792 --> 00:03:10,500
You have no goddamn idea
what you're talking about, Ross!

44
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,875
There could be thousands of them,
tens of thousands!

45
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,500
And you would never know.

46
00:03:18,042 --> 00:03:22,792
Okay, Prescod, let's play a little game
of forest for the trees, shall we?

47
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:27,292
Yes, Skrulls can shapeshift.
Yes, they're looking for a new home.

48
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:28,958
But, as you say,

49
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,917
the only Skrull contact
has been through Nick Fury.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,667
That means they're our allies.

51
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,750
Then where is Fury?

52
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:38,208
He's on S.A.B.E.R.!

53
00:03:38,292 --> 00:03:42,458
God... And if I'm gonna bring him down
for whatever the hell this is,

54
00:03:42,542 --> 00:03:46,208
I need to give him something
more than just theories, I need evidence.

55
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:58,833
All these other attacks,

56
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:03,417
they would be nothing compared to this.

57
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:08,417
This is the one
that sets the world on fire.

58
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:31,417
I stopped filing reports at the office.
Don't know who I can trust anymore.

59
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,833
Other than you...

60
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:36,208
Hey, Prescod, look,
I'm here to help. Okay?

61
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:41,667
So... So let me take this
and I'll give the information to Fury.

62
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,875
Okay?

63
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,375
Yeah.

64
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,833
I need an extract. Fast.

65
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:38,833
<i>I need an extract.</i>

66
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,833
Academica Metro Station,
six blocks northeast.

67
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,375
Ross.

68
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:16,958
Show me your hands.

69
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,583
- Talos.
- It's me.

70
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:26,250
What the hell are you doing here?

71
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,417
I'm chasing him.

72
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:39,875
He was one of you.

73
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,333
No, he's...

74
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,083
He... He's one of them.

75
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:20,875
Welcome back to Earth.

76
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:34,875
He's upstairs.

77
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:49,458
Is that from home?

78
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,292
Santo Millika.

79
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,708
That's a Skrull sky plant.

80
00:11:55,375 --> 00:12:00,333
Soren. She brought the seed with her
wherever she went.

81
00:12:00,417 --> 00:12:05,250
And it's changed since she planted it.
It's adapted to the planet.

82
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:09,042
Yeah, well,
you always believed that was possible.

83
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,167
I still do.

84
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,167
I am so sorry.

85
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,750
Me, too.

86
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,667
Soren loved you.

87
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,917
But she worried, mate,

88
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,708
that it would take something like this
to bring you back to Earth.

89
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:34,250
And I guess she was right.

90
00:12:41,917 --> 00:12:43,292
Tell me about Gravik.

91
00:12:44,542 --> 00:12:47,042
Let's... Let's just
talk about you first, yeah?

92
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:54,833
We've been helping you for all these years
to ensure that you kept your promise.

93
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,000
But after The Blip, you were different.

94
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:03,000
And then you disappeared.

95
00:13:05,042 --> 00:13:07,750
Carol Danvers disappeared.

96
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,958
And so did G'iah.

97
00:13:10,042 --> 00:13:13,042
Hold it. Your daughter?
Disappeared too... Where?

98
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,250
She was young.

99
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,750
Angry that our people
still don't have a home.

100
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:19,708
Many of them are upset.

101
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,250
I got kicked off the Council,
pushed into exile.

102
00:13:25,292 --> 00:13:26,375
But, Gravik...

103
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:33,875
Gravik, mate, he took your abandonment
that much harder.

104
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,542
Come on.

105
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:41,042
Gravik is now the newest member
of the Skrull Council.

106
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:44,958
He preys on the collective rage
of young, displaced Skrulls.

107
00:13:45,042 --> 00:13:46,292
Where is his ass?

108
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:47,958
He's here. He's in Russia.

109
00:13:48,042 --> 00:13:50,000
Skrulls are immune to radioactivity

110
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,917
and Russia has the most abandoned
nuclear plants on Earth.

111
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,292
But here's the thing.
These plants, they're not on the books.

112
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,875
And we don't know where he is.

113
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,083
Well, what else do we know
about his plans?

114
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:04,375
Well, he's already made them.

115
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:08,375
This is what Agent Ross's imposter
was trying to cover up.

116
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,583
Schematics for a dirty bomb
intercepted by Prescod.

117
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:15,208
Prescod had been monitoring
a new radical group called the AAR,

118
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:16,583
Americans Against Russia,

119
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:20,333
which he believed to be the next
Skrull front for a terrorist attack.

120
00:14:20,417 --> 00:14:23,875
Gravik's trying to start a war between
Russia and the United States?

121
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:25,125
That was Prescod's theory.

122
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,125
And he's gonna use this bomb to do it?

123
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:29,750
Does he have the materials for that?

124
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:32,125
A weapons cache in Kazakhstan,

125
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,625
raided the same day
that Prescod was killed.

126
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:37,292
We brought you here for a reason.

127
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,292
If he succeeds, um,

128
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,375
your species will cease to exist.

129
00:14:48,042 --> 00:14:49,083
Shit.

130
00:14:49,917 --> 00:14:51,292
I'm going for a walk.

131
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:54,167
You're going for a walk in Moscow
at night?

132
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,792
Well, you're gonna stand out.

133
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,500
We have a situation,
Mr. President.

134
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:06,417
-Concerning?
-Agent Fury.

135
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,417
We've just received word
that he's left S.A.B.E.R.

136
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,250
What do you mean, "He left S.A.B.E.R.?"

137
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:14,208
Well, I can try to think of
a different word. Abandoned, departed...

138
00:15:14,292 --> 00:15:17,500
Agent Fury is building up the most
complex aerospace defense system

139
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,208
in the history of mankind.

140
00:15:19,292 --> 00:15:21,250
- He can't just leave.
- No, I agree, sir.

141
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,458
And unfortunately,

142
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:26,167
we also intercepted an encrypted message
from Agent Hill to Agent Fury.

143
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,042
We haven't been able to decode it yet,
but we know they're old friends.

144
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:34,042
Given the fact that I could reach
neither Agent Hill nor Agent Fury,

145
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:36,875
they're effectively AWOL.

146
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:38,750
Deal with it.

147
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:39,917
Yes, sir.

148
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:52,000
WOMAN:This is so exciting.

149
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:54,292
Let's see, large Black man, Moscow.

150
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:58,583
Well, it could either be Nick Fury,
or the ghost of Paul Robeson.

151
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:00,375
Okay, go ahead, take the hood off.

152
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:04,708
Oh! Damn, and I was hoping for a command
performance of <i>Ol' Man River.</i>

153
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:07,250
Good to see you too, Sonya.

154
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:13,417
So, did you just have me extraordinarily
renditioned by a group of your thugs?

155
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,917
Were you lot extraordinary?

156
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:16,583
Oh!

157
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:19,167
You usually only
scratch the surface of mediocrity.

158
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,167
You must be finally
putting it all together. Well done.

159
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,208
Okay. You can go. That's... That'll do.

160
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:28,292
"Extraordinary," well, that's wonderful.

161
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:32,792
It is so good to see you.

162
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,667
You look amazing.

163
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,875
Thanks.

164
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:42,292
- Drink?
-Love one.

165
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,625
Do you have some sort of clock fetish
that you've been

166
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:49,167
keeping from me all these years?

167
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,417
It was an old English spymaster
that started the tradition.

168
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,208
A clock goes up
when your time in circus is done.

169
00:17:56,042 --> 00:17:59,083
And I like to think I still have
a few juggling acts left in me.

170
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,958
Oh. Make yourself at home, Fury.

171
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:13,667
I'm pretty sure you recollect
my drink of choice as bourbon.

172
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,292
I might have welcomed you home,

173
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,167
but I still haven't forgiven you
for destroying my expensive flat.

174
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,375
You mean city.

175
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,250
It's bottom shelf piss for you or nothing.

176
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,375
So, what are you doing in Moscow?

177
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,042
Same as you, trying to kill
the Skrull rebellion in its crib.

178
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,875
You know the rebel leader personally,
don't you?

179
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,958
I knew him.

180
00:18:38,042 --> 00:18:40,625
Is that why you came down
from your space station?

181
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:42,500
You feel responsible?

182
00:18:47,792 --> 00:18:50,708
What do you know about a heist

183
00:18:50,792 --> 00:18:54,417
at a black market storage facility
in Kazakhstan?

184
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,833
It happened couple days ago.

185
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,167
Doesn't ring a bell.

186
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:05,708
You know, I may not know
when a Skrull is pretending to be a human,

187
00:19:06,292 --> 00:19:09,208
but I sure as hell know
when a human is lying.

188
00:19:09,292 --> 00:19:12,042
You know damn well
what was in that storage vault.

189
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,917
The fact that you don't know

190
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,208
tells me all I need to know
about this new, rather old Nick Fury.

191
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,625
I think that Thanos's snap changed you.

192
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:23,458
Taught you that no matter
how hard you fight for what's right,

193
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:26,083
there's always someone stronger
to undermine you.

194
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:30,083
You seem to forget this "old Nick Fury"

195
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:33,375
has 30 years
of hands-on experience with the Skrulls.

196
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:37,667
I know the nature of this threat
way better than you ever will.

197
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:41,958
Is that your idea of an offer
of some sort of collaboration between us?

198
00:19:42,042 --> 00:19:44,500
We used to work pretty well together
back in the day.

199
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,208
Back then, you would've seen
my rather mediocre bag men

200
00:19:47,292 --> 00:19:48,417
coming a mile away.

201
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,458
The fact that you didn't see them

202
00:19:50,542 --> 00:19:54,000
means you haven't a hope in hell
of seeing Gravik and his rebels coming.

203
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,667
Which makes you as a partner
rather pointless.

204
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:00,083
I let your men take me
so I could get to you.

205
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:04,333
I mean this as a friend, Fury,
but go back to your space station.

206
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,708
You're in no shape
for this fight that lies before us.

207
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,250
I'll have one of my thugs
drop you back at the safe house.

208
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,792
That's all right, I'll walk.

209
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:20,875
If your memory jogs about
that Kazakhstan thing,

210
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,042
call a brother.

211
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:44,792
What do you want?

212
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:47,708
Home in my own skin.

213
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,333
Take your natural form.

214
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,833
Welcome to New Skrullos.

215
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,208
What's your name?

216
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:02,958
Beto.

217
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,417
When's the last time you ate, Beto?

218
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:09,833
I don't know.

219
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,958
This can't be.

220
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,875
We grow only Skrull produce here.

221
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:27,875
Drink Skrull wine, wear Skrull skins.

222
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:32,375
Whatever dangers you risked getting here,
know, they're worth it.

223
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:43,333
Thank you.

224
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:45,500
You're very welcome.

225
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,458
We're over 500 strong now.

226
00:23:41,042 --> 00:23:42,917
So, is everyone a part of...

227
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,708
The resistance? No.
Gravik provides refuge.

228
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:49,625
But if you do choose to be a warrior,
there is one advantage.

229
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,250
Oh, yeah? What's that?

230
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:52,500
You get to leave.

231
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:54,958
Everyone else stays in the compound.

232
00:23:55,875 --> 00:23:59,542
The warriors keep our human form,
the longer we're attached to our shells,

233
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:03,292
the less likely we can be identified
by humans and Skrulls alike.

234
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:10,000
Wait here
and someone will get you a proper room.

235
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:12,792
Prove your loyalty
and Gravik will reward you.

236
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:15,750
What's behind there?

237
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:18,625
Victory.

238
00:24:45,667 --> 00:24:47,125
What is your name?

239
00:24:47,208 --> 00:24:48,500
Warrior.

240
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:50,000
What is your fight?

241
00:24:50,083 --> 00:24:51,125
Skrullos.

242
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:52,500
What is your dream?

243
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:54,667
Home in my own skin.

244
00:24:57,917 --> 00:24:59,542
Bring him his shell.

245
00:24:59,625 --> 00:25:01,375
No. No!

246
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:12,917
Americans Against Russia,
your dreams are about to come true.

247
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,708
Take his face.

248
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:23,750
No!

249
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:34,000
Now take his mind.

250
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,292
Skrulls have infiltrated
the ranks of major world powers.

251
00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:56,875
<i>Where is the proof?</i>

252
00:25:56,958 --> 00:25:58,875
<i>How about the arrival of Agent Fury?</i>

253
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:02,292
<i>For a man who sworn off Earth,</i>
<i>he would not have returned without cause.</i>

254
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:03,667
You got that right.

255
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:06,833
<i>Gravik has something very big</i>
<i>up his sleeve.</i>

256
00:26:06,917 --> 00:26:09,542
<i>But the immediate threat</i>
<i>remains the bombs.</i>

257
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:13,250
<i>Five specialists in Moscow</i>
<i>are capable of building such an explosive.</i>

258
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:14,792
<i>My money's on this one.</i>

259
00:26:15,458 --> 00:26:17,917
<i>Vasily Poprishchin.</i>
<i>Former Chechnyan rebel,</i>

260
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
<i>owns a high-end gallery</i>
<i>in the city center,</i>

261
00:26:20,083 --> 00:26:23,458
<i>restores pigmented paintings</i>
<i>and radioactivated bombs.</i>

262
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:25,250
<i>Send in a raid now.</i>

263
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,625
<i>If by "now" you mean,</i>

264
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:29,125
<i>"Wait until a Skrull rebel</i>
<i>picks up a device</i>

265
00:26:29,208 --> 00:26:32,625
<i>in order to follow them to their hideout,"</i>
<i>then, yes, I totally agree.</i>

266
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:34,833
She's cheeky.

267
00:26:34,917 --> 00:26:37,292
Yeah, 'till she sees
an ugly-ass Skrull like you.

268
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:38,875
Then she goes into hunting mode.

269
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:41,750
I'm considered good-looking
amongst my kind.

270
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:44,500
I know a bunch of good-looking Skrull.
And you ain't one of them.

271
00:26:44,583 --> 00:26:46,500
All right, guys,
what is the play here?

272
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:49,083
I say we visit this Rusky bomb builder.

273
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:50,917
Sonya will already have agents there.

274
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,708
Who we will incapacitate.

275
00:26:52,792 --> 00:26:53,917
Hold on, stop.

276
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,250
You're talking about
attacking MI6 operatives?

277
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:00,292
Talos,
let me explain something to you.

278
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:03,000
We're no longer
in "just a war" with Gravik.

279
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:07,542
We are in a race with Sonya Falsworth,
who celebrates a scorched-Earth policy,

280
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:10,000
meaning, she will annihilate
any and everyone

281
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:12,500
who's ever even heard the name "Gravik."

282
00:27:12,958 --> 00:27:15,667
You wanna save innocent Skrulls,
you'll have to hurt some people.

283
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,750
All right...

284
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:18,542
Look, Gravik knows that...

285
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:20,500
mercy's your weakness.

286
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:22,792
Time for you to prove him wrong.

287
00:27:23,875 --> 00:27:24,875
Hmm?

288
00:27:25,792 --> 00:27:26,792
Yeah, okay.

289
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,250
Fury's in town, G.

290
00:27:52,708 --> 00:27:53,750
Is he?

291
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:56,917
Our man says it's nothing to worry about.

292
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,375
He's washed up, walks with a limp,
can barely see with the good eye.

293
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,708
I see you've kept the circle tight
on this one.

294
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:06,958
We're the circle. No one else.

295
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:09,375
Is that to protect me, or the cause?

296
00:28:15,042 --> 00:28:17,792
You are the cause.

297
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:19,083
I'm not the cause.

298
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:22,000
Cause is home.

299
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:23,667
Yes, sir.

300
00:28:24,792 --> 00:28:28,417
We go tomorrow
and we don't stop until Earth is ours.

301
00:28:33,042 --> 00:28:35,208
-What about it?
-This place is massive.

302
00:28:35,292 --> 00:28:36,292
You.

303
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:37,958
Come with me.

304
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,167
Zirksu will drive you.

305
00:28:47,833 --> 00:28:49,667
You take the cash to this address.

306
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,917
You deal with Poprishchin and no one else.

307
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,333
He'll give you two bags.

308
00:28:53,417 --> 00:28:56,375
You get 'em to the Moscow safe house
undisturbed and intact.

309
00:29:39,583 --> 00:29:40,958
Where's the bloody coffee?

310
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:48,083
What's our MI6 status?

311
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,083
All set.

312
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:10,292
You Poprishchin?

313
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:19,542
-Oh, shit.
-I got it, mate.

314
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:25,500
Not bad for a 136-year-old.

315
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:29,042
Well, you know,
I'm not even 40 in human years.

316
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:32,333
I haven't even gone
on my midlife crisis shopping spree yet.

317
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:34,083
Hey.

318
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:36,417
What'd you get for yours?

319
00:30:37,958 --> 00:30:38,958
The Avengers.

320
00:30:58,375 --> 00:31:01,458
No, mate, we don't want
any of your shitty paintings.

321
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:03,750
Then exactly what do you want?

322
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,167
Some damn good answers.

323
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,583
I've got eyes
on a possible person of interest.

324
00:31:20,667 --> 00:31:22,625
Initiating foot pursuit.
I'll keep you posted.

325
00:31:22,708 --> 00:31:24,000
Yeah, just keep me informed.

326
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:27,625
I'm sorry, but you gentlemen
will have to call at another time.

327
00:31:27,708 --> 00:31:30,417
- I'm late for an appointment.
- Oh! Oh, who you meetin' with?

328
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,042
My wife, Mister...

329
00:31:32,208 --> 00:31:33,208
Oh!

330
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,125
Ooh! Damn, this is nice.

331
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:38,167
That chair belonged to Louis XV.
It's priceless.

332
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:42,292
Everything is priceless till it gets
blown to bits in a hail of bullets.

333
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:47,417
Agent Keller, anything in our file
about this one having a wife?

334
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,333
Yeah, has an ex-wife,

335
00:31:49,417 --> 00:31:51,542
lives in Miami with a soccer player.

336
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:56,458
Oh, so we gonna go ahead
and call that a lie.

337
00:31:56,542 --> 00:31:58,375
Everybody gets one.

338
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,667
Nobody gets two.

339
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:04,083
So, last chance.

340
00:32:04,542 --> 00:32:06,625
Who are you going to meet?

341
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:11,167
Perhaps we'd all be more comfortable
in the gallery space

342
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,792
where there is more natural light.

343
00:32:12,875 --> 00:32:16,250
You got any more of these comfortable-ass
Louis XIV chairs in there?

344
00:32:16,333 --> 00:32:17,417
Mmm-mmm.

345
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,792
How about a dirty bomb?

346
00:32:19,375 --> 00:32:21,958
Or you keep that in a crate
in here somewhere?

347
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:25,833
I'm sorry, I do not know this term.
Dirty bomb?

348
00:32:25,917 --> 00:32:28,917
Boom, goes the dynamite! Lie number two.

349
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:34,583
I just told you.
Everybody gets one, nobody gets two.

350
00:32:35,417 --> 00:32:36,708
You going to shoot me?

351
00:32:36,792 --> 00:32:39,375
Maybe. Well, probably.

352
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,667
But not right now.

353
00:32:42,917 --> 00:32:44,125
Where are the bombs?

354
00:32:47,208 --> 00:32:48,667
Your name's not Keller.

355
00:32:53,917 --> 00:32:54,917
Skrull.

356
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,250
Your name is Talos.

357
00:32:59,917 --> 00:33:01,042
Talos?

358
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:03,208
I got this.

359
00:33:03,292 --> 00:33:04,375
You sure?

360
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:12,042
This is my fight!

361
00:33:12,125 --> 00:33:13,792
I said no!

362
00:33:28,042 --> 00:33:29,875
Tell me where the bombs are!

363
00:33:29,958 --> 00:33:31,792
You betray your own people.

364
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:51,875
Come on.

365
00:33:55,417 --> 00:33:56,667
I said no.

366
00:35:20,375 --> 00:35:21,417
Where'd he go?

367
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,667
She.

368
00:35:24,292 --> 00:35:29,333
Stop! Stop! Stop!

369
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:32,500
Last warning!

370
00:35:39,125 --> 00:35:41,458
It's what you always say
but there's always another.

371
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,333
G'iah.

372
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,958
- Give me the bombs.
- No.

373
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,083
I know you're angry. This isn't you.

374
00:35:58,167 --> 00:36:00,625
This is not
what your mother would've wanted.

375
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:02,625
Mum doesn't know what she wants.

376
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:07,375
Her last words, "Find G'iah."

377
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,208
What?

378
00:36:13,792 --> 00:36:14,833
She's dead.

379
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:22,417
How?

380
00:36:24,625 --> 00:36:28,375
Why don't you ask
the people that you work for?

381
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:35,208
Why don't you
just give me the bomb, please?

382
00:36:37,083 --> 00:36:40,542
G'iah, give me the bomb.

383
00:36:42,542 --> 00:36:44,917
- I can't.
- Just hand it over.

384
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,125
And you'll walk away.

385
00:36:47,167 --> 00:36:50,250
'Cause you know that I'll protect you.

386
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,917
- You can't protect anyone.
- G'iah, I know...

387
00:38:38,292 --> 00:38:39,875
Making friends
with the locals?

388
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:47,208
How do you think
we kept the Cold War from going hot?

389
00:38:48,583 --> 00:38:50,375
Spooks like me buying shots.

390
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:51,833
You can't say that.

391
00:38:51,917 --> 00:38:54,083
No. You can't say that.

392
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:58,250
Mmm!

393
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:03,333
It's good to have you back, Fury.

394
00:39:03,792 --> 00:39:08,167
Is that sincere
or you just covering your bases?

395
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,958
You'll tell me why you abandoned Earth?

396
00:39:10,042 --> 00:39:12,375
Well, building out S.A.B.E.R.

397
00:39:12,458 --> 00:39:15,542
Traditionally, we tell the truth
during our chess games.

398
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:18,875
Maybe that has changed too, though,
I don't know.

399
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:24,208
Okay, let's just say
I had a crisis of faith.

400
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:26,625
So why'd you come back?

401
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,333
It followed me up there,

402
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:33,250
and I owe it to Talos.

403
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:35,667
You sure you're not talking
about someone else?

404
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:43,208
You gonna move?

405
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:46,458
I haven't decided.

406
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,750
See, that's what I'm worried about.

407
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,708
The Fury I knew
was always three steps ahead.

408
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:58,417
If I remember correctly, you called me.

409
00:39:58,917 --> 00:40:00,583
Upon Talos's request.

410
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:05,375
Your lack of contact over the past
few years sent a pretty clear message.

411
00:40:05,458 --> 00:40:06,708
Meaning?

412
00:40:13,417 --> 00:40:15,458
You're not ready for this, Fury.

413
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,875
There's a very real threat out there.

414
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:22,250
You were never the same after The Blip.

415
00:40:22,333 --> 00:40:25,333
You always told me there is no shame

416
00:40:25,417 --> 00:40:28,625
in walking away
when the steps are uncertain.

417
00:40:30,417 --> 00:40:31,625
So check your footing.

418
00:40:33,042 --> 00:40:34,667
Otherwise someone's gonna get hurt.

419
00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:49,750
Oh, no.

420
00:40:51,042 --> 00:40:52,167
Mother...

421
00:41:25,917 --> 00:41:26,917
Good work.

422
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:30,042
I barely made it out.
Someone was waiting for me.

423
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:34,583
Someone you can identify?

424
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:35,750
No.

425
00:41:37,542 --> 00:41:39,000
Maybe we postpone the strike.

426
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:45,375
To the contrary.
Thanks to you, we have the bait.

427
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,250
Thanks for coming to see me.

428
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:01,333
You don't see me because I'm not here.

429
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:03,875
I understand. You're taking a risk.

430
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,375
A risk?

431
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:10,042
Is that what you explained to Mum,
that following you could get her killed?

432
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:15,375
Your mother died
while you were working for her killer.

433
00:43:16,042 --> 00:43:19,208
So do not take me down that road, G'iah.

434
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:22,583
You have one chance to save yourself.

435
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:24,250
And I think you know that.

436
00:43:25,292 --> 00:43:27,000
I think that's why you're here.

437
00:43:35,375 --> 00:43:37,625
The attack is planned for tomorrow.

438
00:43:37,708 --> 00:43:38,833
Unity Day.

439
00:43:40,458 --> 00:43:43,958
There are three bombs.
And Gravik knows you'll be there.

440
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:46,500
- How?
- I don't know.

441
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:50,750
There are so many operatives in the field.
A hundred, at least.

442
00:43:51,542 --> 00:43:52,667
Fracking pods?

443
00:43:53,083 --> 00:43:55,708
Most of their identities are kept secret,
even from us.

444
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,875
Your mum would be very proud of you,
you know, for coming to see me.

445
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:16,417
Tomorrow, there are three couriers,
including me.

446
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:19,083
All the points
near Vossoyedineniye Square.

447
00:44:20,042 --> 00:44:22,167
I'll mark each bag with infrared spray.

448
00:44:31,583 --> 00:44:33,000
G'iah's come back.

449
00:44:58,333 --> 00:44:59,583
I got eyes on her.

450
00:45:00,792 --> 00:45:02,208
<i>Two backpacks.</i>

451
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:05,000
I got her.

452
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:07,458
Remember we're tracking the bags,
not the people.

453
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:10,500
Lot of backpacks in Central Moscow.

454
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:13,750
G'iah's painted ours with infrared spray.

455
00:45:14,792 --> 00:45:16,083
Infrared. Got it.

456
00:45:29,083 --> 00:45:30,333
We missed the pass.

457
00:45:38,625 --> 00:45:40,500
Got one carrier going northeast.

458
00:45:43,125 --> 00:45:45,583
The other one south. Let's move.

459
00:45:50,708 --> 00:45:52,125
Excuse me. Excuse me!

460
00:48:05,958 --> 00:48:08,458
It's empty. They're decoys.

461
00:48:52,875 --> 00:48:53,917
Hill!

462
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,833
- Maria!
- It was you.

463
00:49:35,667 --> 00:49:36,667
Not me.
