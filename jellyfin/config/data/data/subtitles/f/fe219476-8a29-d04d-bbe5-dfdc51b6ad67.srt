<i>The Clone Starfleet is under siege.</i>

4
00:00:21,672 --> 00:00:23,838
<i>Dozens of Republic warships</i>

5
00:00:23,922 --> 00:00:27,046
<i>in merciless surprise attacks</i>

6
00:00:27,213 --> 00:00:29,755
<i>Rumors spread</i>

7
00:00:29,838 --> 00:00:31,797
<i>In the face of growing fear,</i>

8
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,046
<i>the Jedi Council sends Master Plo Koon</i>

[dramatic choral music]

11
00:00:48,713 --> 00:00:51,213
The enemy ship has reduced
its speed, general.

12
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,630
They must have realized
we are tracking them.

13
00:00:58,797 --> 00:01:00,797
We're tracking three Republic cruisers.

14
00:01:01,046 --> 00:01:02,838
-What should we do?
-[roars]

15
00:01:02,922 --> 00:01:05,046
Jam their transmissions.

16
00:01:06,797 --> 00:01:08,922
The fleet is holding its position, sir.

17
00:01:09,004 --> 00:01:13,046
I think it wise to report
our position before we attack.

18
00:01:14,254 --> 00:01:16,672
Skywalker's fleet is nearby,
in the Bith system.

19
00:01:16,755 --> 00:01:19,296
Good. Perhaps he can reinforce us.

20
00:01:19,588 --> 00:01:20,755
From what I hear,

21
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,922
Skywalker's always ready for a fight.

22
00:01:23,213 --> 00:01:24,380
So I've heard.

23
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:28,713
<i>Koh-to-ya, Master Plo.</i>

24
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,672
Koh-to-ya, little 'soka.

25
00:01:30,755 --> 00:01:32,755
<i>How's the hunt</i>
<i>for the mystery weapon going?</i>

26
00:01:32,838 --> 00:01:34,963
We've tracked it to the Abregado system.

27
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:36,880
We need reinforcements.

28
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:39,046
<i>I'll have to ask the council, Master Plo.</i>

29
00:01:39,213 --> 00:01:41,505
<i>I was given strict orders</i>
<i>to protect our staging area.</i>

31
00:01:43,797 --> 00:01:45,505
<i>Master Plo, what's happen--?</i>

32
00:01:45,588 --> 00:01:47,672
What is wrong with the transmission?

33
00:01:47,755 --> 00:01:50,254
There's too much interference, sir.
We've lost 'em.

34
00:01:50,838 --> 00:01:52,046
You heard Master Plo.

35
00:01:52,338 --> 00:01:55,088
He needs our support.
We have to go help him.

36
00:01:55,213 --> 00:01:57,421
We have to see
what the Council decides first.

37
00:01:57,672 --> 00:01:59,463
This is an important meeting, Ahsoka.

38
00:01:59,546 --> 00:02:03,338
Remember, be mindful
and speak only when spoken to.

39
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:04,713
Don't I always.

40
00:02:06,463 --> 00:02:09,046
<i>This mystery weapon</i>
<i>has struck in a dozen systems</i>

41

42
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:14,421
<i>We cannot afford to lose</i>
<i>any more ships, my friends.</i>

43
00:02:14,838 --> 00:02:16,755
<i>Ah, Master Skywalker.</i>

44
00:02:16,963 --> 00:02:18,546
<i>Have you had any success</i>

45
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,838
<i>in finding General Grievous'</i>
<i>secret weapon?</i>

46
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,380
Master Plo was here in the Abregado system
when we lost contact.

47
00:02:28,588 --> 00:02:29,838
The enemy ship is closing.

48
00:02:29,922 --> 00:02:31,546
Prepare for battle.

49
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,630
[dramatic music]

50
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:39,838
General Grievous, this will be
a suitable test for our new weapon.

51
00:02:39,922 --> 00:02:41,922
You may fire when ready.

52
00:02:42,004 --> 00:02:43,338
Yes, my lord.

53
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,004
We're picking up a large energy reading
from the target, sir.

54
00:02:49,088 --> 00:02:50,213
Open fire.

55
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:51,755
We're not in range yet, sir.

56
00:02:52,338 --> 00:02:53,380
Fire!

57
00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:01,421
Brace for impact!

58
00:03:03,421 --> 00:03:04,713
We're losing all our power.

59
00:03:06,254 --> 00:03:08,421
That energy field has left us defenseless!

60
00:03:09,546 --> 00:03:13,296
-Their shields are down.
-All cannons, fire.

61
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,505
They're tearing us apart one by one.

62
00:03:19,588 --> 00:03:21,505
[laughs]

63
00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:31,380
Agh!

64
00:03:31,463 --> 00:03:33,338
Quickly, into the pods!

65
00:03:37,713 --> 00:03:41,338
We don't have much time.
Get inside. Hurry!

66
00:03:49,922 --> 00:03:53,755
Another successful test,
wouldn't you say, count?

67
00:03:53,838 --> 00:03:57,797
We must keep our position secret.
Send out the hunters.

68
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:01,755
I want all of those lifepods destroyed.

69
00:04:01,838 --> 00:04:03,630
[chuckling]

70
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,004
And we have had no further contact
with General Plo Koon.

71
00:04:11,088 --> 00:04:14,213
The absence of distress beacons
indicates that his fleet was...

72
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,421
That his fleet was destroyed,
like the others.

73
00:04:17,505 --> 00:04:19,380
We are about to prepare a rescue mission.

74
00:04:19,463 --> 00:04:22,046
<i>Hasn't Clone Intelligence reported</i>
<i>this weapon</i>

75
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,713
<i>never leaves any survivors?</i>

76
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:26,296
<i>The Separatists are being unusually tidy.</i>

77
00:04:26,296 --> 00:04:28,630
<i>They don't want any witnesses.</i>

78
00:04:28,713 --> 00:04:32,755
<i>Tragic are these losses,</i>
<i>but prevent more we must.</i>

79
00:04:36,588 --> 00:04:38,004
The power grid is burned out.

80
00:04:38,088 --> 00:04:42,713
We've no engine, communications,
or... or life support recharge.

81
00:04:42,797 --> 00:04:45,546
So we'll just sit here
and hold our breath.

82
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,588
Someone will come looking for us, right?

83
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:53,171
Let's get the power restored
so we are here to be found.

84
00:05:00,046 --> 00:05:01,838
<i>All our battle groups will be reassigned</i>

85
00:05:01,922 --> 00:05:05,421
<i>to guard our supply convoys,</i>
<i>including yours, Skywalker.</i>

86
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:08,797
<i>I'm afraid we can't risk any more ships</i>
<i>with a rescue mission.</i>

87
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,838
Wait!

88
00:05:09,922 --> 00:05:12,380
Just because there haven't
been any survivors before

89
00:05:12,463 --> 00:05:14,546
doesn't mean there won't be any this time.

90
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,338
<i>Boldly spoken for one so young.</i>

91
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:21,338
<i>She is learning from Anakin.</i>

92
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,129
Excuse my Padawan.

93
00:05:23,546 --> 00:05:25,713
We will deploy
as you have instructed, master.

94
00:05:28,505 --> 00:05:29,838
Ahsoka!

95
00:05:29,922 --> 00:05:32,838
If anyone could survive, Master Plo could.

96
00:05:32,922 --> 00:05:34,254
I don't understand why--

97
00:05:34,338 --> 00:05:36,380
What you don't understand is Jedi protocol

98
00:05:36,463 --> 00:05:38,588
or your place, my young Padawan.

99
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:39,630
Admiral. [clears throat]

100
00:05:39,713 --> 00:05:42,254
We'll split up our ships
to maximize our defense area.

101
00:05:42,463 --> 00:05:43,922
I'll scout ahead for enemy activity.

102
00:05:44,046 --> 00:05:46,922
Isn't that risky,
with the mystery weapon out there?

103
00:05:47,004 --> 00:05:50,421
It might be, but I know
you won't argue my orders.

104
00:05:51,463 --> 00:05:52,797
Come on, Snips.

105
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:00,880
The air in here is getting a bit stale.

106
00:06:00,963 --> 00:06:02,254
Don't look at me.

107
00:06:02,505 --> 00:06:03,922
It's Boost, sir.

108
00:06:04,004 --> 00:06:06,463
-He only takes a bath when he's on leave.
-Save it.

109
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,713
Just keep working on the pod,
not your jokes.

110
00:06:08,797 --> 00:06:11,046
Do you think we've got a chance, general?

111
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:13,421
I don't believe in chance, commander.

112
00:06:13,505 --> 00:06:16,046
I know if we work together,
we will stay alive,

113
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,963
and someone will find us.

114
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:22,338
With all due respect, general,

115
00:06:22,797 --> 00:06:26,421
strategically, it doesn't make any sense
for someone to come look for us.

116
00:06:26,546 --> 00:06:29,254
If I was in command,
I'd be hunting that weapon down.

117
00:06:29,338 --> 00:06:33,588
I value your life more
than finding that weapon.

118
00:06:33,672 --> 00:06:35,755
Sir, there's another pod out there.

119
00:06:38,713 --> 00:06:41,129
If we only had power,
we could contact them.

120
00:06:41,213 --> 00:06:44,463
Well, how about we just wave "hello"
when the viewport comes around?

121
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:52,338
They're dead.

122
00:06:52,421 --> 00:06:55,046
Someone busted that pod wide open.

123
00:06:57,421 --> 00:07:00,129
We are not alone out here.

124
00:07:06,546 --> 00:07:08,129
Set those new coordinates, R2?

125
00:07:08,213 --> 00:07:09,129
[beeps]

126
00:07:09,213 --> 00:07:11,880
Master, I should tell you
why I spoke up before.

127
00:07:11,963 --> 00:07:13,380
You don't have to explain anything.

128
00:07:29,338 --> 00:07:31,463
Our ship's in defensive formation, sir.

129
00:07:31,546 --> 00:07:34,421
All right, commander.
I'll check on Anakin's progress.

130
00:07:37,171 --> 00:07:39,046
Admiral, how goes escort?

131
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:42,213
<i>Oh. Convoys are proceeding</i>
<i>on schedule, general.</i>

132
00:07:42,338 --> 00:07:43,880
<i>No sign of enemy activity.</i>

133
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,838
And where's Skywalker?

134
00:07:45,922 --> 00:07:48,588
<i>Uh, the general felt</i>
<i>a redeployment of this fleet</i>

135
00:07:48,672 --> 00:07:50,755
<i>would increase our defensive perimeter.</i>

136
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:52,797
I see. Thank you, admiral.

137
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,963
That'll be all.

138
00:07:56,213 --> 00:07:57,171
Problem, sir?

139
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,213
Anakin has just redeployed himself...
again.

140
00:08:09,254 --> 00:08:10,254
[beeps]

141
00:08:10,338 --> 00:08:12,004
R2, set up the scanner.

142
00:08:12,088 --> 00:08:15,171
Modulate for incoming... mystery weapons.

143
00:08:15,254 --> 00:08:16,296
[beeps]

144
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,046
No, R2, tune the scanners
for life-forms,

145
00:08:19,254 --> 00:08:20,421
highest sensitivity.

146
00:08:20,505 --> 00:08:22,755
Why would we scan for life-forms to spot

147
00:08:22,838 --> 00:08:24,838
an enemy weapon probably
just filled with...

148
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,380
battle... droids.

149
00:08:27,755 --> 00:08:29,171
The Abregado system.

150
00:08:29,672 --> 00:08:30,672
Huh.

151
00:08:30,755 --> 00:08:33,630
So it's okay when you don't follow
what the Council says.

152
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:36,338
Doing what the Jedi Council
says, that's one thing.

153
00:08:36,505 --> 00:08:38,922
How we go about doing it, that's another.

154
00:08:39,296 --> 00:08:41,672
That's what I'm trying
to teach you, my young Padawan.

155
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:44,129
So you always meant
to come out here for survivors?

156
00:08:44,213 --> 00:08:46,129
Lives are in danger, Ahsoka.

157
00:08:46,213 --> 00:08:47,755
We can't just turn our backs on them.

158
00:08:47,838 --> 00:08:49,713
That's what I said
back in the briefing room.

159
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:52,588
I know, but the way you said it was wrong.

160
00:08:53,588 --> 00:08:55,505
Hurry up. Switch on the illuminator.

161
00:08:55,588 --> 00:08:58,296
We haven't got much time
before the fleet misses us.

162
00:09:01,088 --> 00:09:02,505
No, that's not it.

163
00:09:02,797 --> 00:09:05,588
This one goes there. That one goes there.

164
00:09:05,672 --> 00:09:08,380
Are you sure?
We don't want to make things worse.

165
00:09:08,463 --> 00:09:11,129
How are we going to make things worse?

166
00:09:11,922 --> 00:09:13,713
When you ask for trouble,

167
00:09:14,046 --> 00:09:17,588
you should not be surprised
when it finds you.

168
00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:20,046
I think trouble already found us, sir.

169
00:09:21,004 --> 00:09:23,672
What if we connect
these two wires right here?

170
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,004
[whirring noise]

171
00:09:27,088 --> 00:09:28,254
I'm getting something.

172
00:09:28,338 --> 00:09:30,129
[man's voice fades in over radio]

173
00:09:30,213 --> 00:09:32,463
<i>We are under attack. Is anyone out there?</i>

174
00:09:32,546 --> 00:09:34,088
It's one of our other pods.

<i>Is anyone out there?!</i>

177
00:09:39,797 --> 00:09:42,880
That signal is weak.
They must be close by.

178
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:49,838
[man over radio] <i>They've locked on to</i>
<i>our ship. They've locked on to our ship!</i>

179
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,338
Go get 'em, boys.

00:09:54,838 --> 00:09:57,213
[man over radio] <i>Our position</i>

Let's cut this can open.

182
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,672
I have visual contact.

183
00:10:05,963 --> 00:10:08,963
Pod 1-9-7-7, do you copy?

184
00:10:09,046 --> 00:10:10,630
[man over radio] <i>The droids</i>

[men screaming]

187
00:10:17,963 --> 00:10:19,213
There they go.

188
00:10:19,296 --> 00:10:22,088
Things just got a lot worse.

189
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:34,505
The scanners are practically useless.
Got anything on the emergency channel, R2?

190
00:10:34,588 --> 00:10:35,672
[beeps]

191
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:41,838
Now, Ahsoka, we might find something
you don't want to find.

192
00:10:41,922 --> 00:10:44,838
I know, master. But I have to believe.

193
00:10:44,922 --> 00:10:46,755
How do you know Master Plo, anyway?

194
00:10:46,838 --> 00:10:48,463
He's one of my oldest friends.

195
00:10:48,797 --> 00:10:51,046
It was Master Plo Koon
who found me and brought me

196
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:52,838
to the temple where I belonged.

197
00:10:52,922 --> 00:10:56,797
Now he's lost, so I thought
maybe I could find him.

198
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,672
[beeps]

199
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,380
Incoming transmission, master.

200
00:11:01,838 --> 00:11:03,880
I think someone noticed we're gone.

201
00:11:04,171 --> 00:11:06,296
<i>Anakin, where are you?</i>

202
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,880
Oh, hello, master.

203
00:11:08,088 --> 00:11:10,338
Uh, we made a quick stop
in the Abregado system.

204
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:14,254
<i>A rescue mission, I suppose.</i>
<i>You had other orders.</i>

205
00:11:14,338 --> 00:11:16,046
It was my idea, Master Obi-Wan.

206
00:11:16,129 --> 00:11:17,505
<i>Oh, I'm sure.</i>

207
00:11:17,588 --> 00:11:19,463
<i>Well, have you found any survivors?</i>

208
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,254
No, you were right.

209
00:11:21,672 --> 00:11:23,797
The Separatists don't want any witnesses.

210
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,171
<i>All the more reason for you</i>
<i>to rejoin the defensive escorts.</i>

211
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:28,838
<i>We need you, Anakin.</i>

212
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:32,129
<i>You're going to miss the rendezvous</i>
<i>with the fleet if you don't hurry.</i>

213
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:33,838
I know, master. We're on our way.

214
00:11:35,463 --> 00:11:36,546
I'm sorry, Ahsoka.

215
00:11:43,338 --> 00:11:44,588
[beeps]

216
00:11:44,672 --> 00:11:46,630
-What is it, R2?
-[beeping]

217
00:11:46,713 --> 00:11:49,254
R2 thinks he's got something
on the emergency channel.

218
00:11:49,338 --> 00:11:50,963
-Can he trace it?
-[beeps excitedly]

219
00:11:51,046 --> 00:11:52,046
Let's get going.

220
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:56,463
I think they see us.

221
00:11:57,046 --> 00:11:59,588
Corporal, there's another pod over there.

222
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:14,505
[humming "The Imperial March"]

223
00:12:14,588 --> 00:12:16,254
It is time to go.

224
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,713
Go? Where are you going, sir?

225
00:12:20,004 --> 00:12:22,129
Outside, to destroy the enemy.

226
00:12:22,213 --> 00:12:24,421
I can withstand the pressure
for a brief time.

227
00:12:24,505 --> 00:12:26,171
Put your helmets on.

228
00:12:26,254 --> 00:12:28,380
If you say so, sir.

229
00:12:28,463 --> 00:12:30,588
This is a difficult situation,

230
00:12:30,672 --> 00:12:33,755
but there remains a possibility
we will survive.

231
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:36,630
That's good enough for me.
Come on, let's go.

232
00:12:40,672 --> 00:12:41,880
[machinery whirring]

233
00:12:41,963 --> 00:12:43,588
[reverberating thud]

234
00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:47,713
Wolffe, keep
the communications signal alive.

235
00:12:47,797 --> 00:12:50,880
It is our only chance
someone will find us.

236
00:12:50,963 --> 00:12:53,505
Let's just hope someone's looking for us.

237
00:12:56,922 --> 00:12:58,254
[beeps]

238
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:01,380
Are we still picking up that signal?

239
00:13:01,463 --> 00:13:05,838
-Yes, but why aren't we finding anybody?
-I don't know, Ahsoka.

240
00:13:06,213 --> 00:13:07,213
I don't know.

241
00:13:14,463 --> 00:13:16,546
Well, this looks like the last one.

242
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,546
Let's finish the job.

243
00:13:20,046 --> 00:13:22,546
Hey, what's a Jedi doing out here?

00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,672
[lightsaber whooshes]

245
00:13:30,922 --> 00:13:31,838
Take cover!

246
00:13:35,088 --> 00:13:37,880
Is there anyone out there?
This is Ahsoka Tano.

247
00:13:37,963 --> 00:13:39,254
Can anyone hear me?

248
00:13:45,421 --> 00:13:46,880
I can't get a clear shot!

249
00:13:46,963 --> 00:13:49,421
Time to put the squeeze on them.

250
00:13:53,672 --> 00:13:54,880
[metal creaking]

251
00:14:00,463 --> 00:14:02,046
[Ahsoka over radio]
<i>Is there anyone out there?</i>

252
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:04,338
<i>Come in. This is Ahsoka Tano.</i>

253
00:14:04,421 --> 00:14:06,338
<i>Is there anyone out there? Come in.</i>

254
00:14:06,421 --> 00:14:07,505
It's Ahsoka.

255
00:14:07,588 --> 00:14:10,963
-She must be close.
-Keep the signal alive, commander.

256
00:14:11,046 --> 00:14:14,755
-R2, see if you can boost the reception.
-[beeping]

257
00:14:15,296 --> 00:14:16,296
Ugh!

258
00:14:17,004 --> 00:14:20,004
Patience. We're trying to boost
the power. Hang on.

259
00:14:31,588 --> 00:14:32,713
We're losing the signal.

260
00:14:32,797 --> 00:14:34,296
The pod can't take much more damage.

261
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,004
Sinker, your turn.

262
00:14:36,088 --> 00:14:37,171
I'm on it, boss.

263
00:14:37,254 --> 00:14:38,922
Whoa!

264
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:40,421
What the...?

265
00:14:41,588 --> 00:14:43,213
Eat laser, clankers.

266
00:14:54,088 --> 00:14:55,463
[droid] Uh-oh.

267
00:15:00,672 --> 00:15:03,546
Sir, we have lost contact
with the pod hunter.

268
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,880
Perhaps some survivors
are putting up a fight.

269
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:09,713
That is something we cannot allow.

270
00:15:13,672 --> 00:15:17,129

<i>to destroy this mystery weapon.</i>

<i>In this war, a step ahead of us</i>
<i>Dooku always seems.</i>

272
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,463
Tell me,

273
00:15:23,546 --> 00:15:27,588
has there been any word
from Master Plo Koon or his fleet?

274
00:15:28,213 --> 00:15:30,463
<i>No, we must fear the worst.</i>

275
00:15:30,546 --> 00:15:32,797
<i>Actually, I just received word</i>

276
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,672
<i>that Anakin has found</i>
<i>the remains of Master Plo's fleet</i>

277

<i>and is searching the debris for survivors.</i>

278
00:15:38,755 --> 00:15:41,129
On whose authority has he done this?

279
00:15:41,213 --> 00:15:43,088
<i>His own, I'm afraid.</i>

280
00:15:43,171 --> 00:15:45,838
<i>With his fleet out of position,</i>
<i>we are left vulnerable.</i>

281
00:15:45,922 --> 00:15:47,880
<i>Oh, his fleet is right where it should be.</i>

282
00:15:48,088 --> 00:15:51,505
<i>He's taken only a small ship</i>
<i>and his Padawan.</i>

283
00:15:52,588 --> 00:15:54,797
<i>Twice the trouble they have become.</i>

284
00:15:55,505 --> 00:15:58,213
<i>A reckless decision Skywalker has made.</i>

285
00:15:58,713 --> 00:16:01,296
Let us hope it is not a costly one.

286
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:07,254
Well, general, this is
another fine mess we've gotten into.

287
00:16:07,338 --> 00:16:09,755
Your sense of humor is improving.

288
00:16:09,838 --> 00:16:12,296
I don't mean to say I told you so,

289
00:16:12,546 --> 00:16:15,254
but I never believed anyone
would come looking for us.

290
00:16:19,838 --> 00:16:22,254
<i>Anakin, the Council is furious.</i>

291
00:16:22,588 --> 00:16:24,630
<i>Why have you left your post?</i>

292
00:16:24,713 --> 00:16:27,546
I decided we couldn't just
give up on Master Plo Koon.

293
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,254
<i>A noble gesture, Anakin.</i>

294
00:16:29,797 --> 00:16:33,505
<i>But the Council feels your daring</i>
<i>may put others in danger.</i>

295
00:16:34,963 --> 00:16:37,046
<i>Please listen to me, Anakin.</i>

296
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,546
<i>Return at once.</i>

297
00:16:38,922 --> 00:16:40,213
[Anakin] Yes, Excellency.

298
00:16:52,963 --> 00:16:54,171
Time to go, Ahsoka.

299
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,296
We have to stay.

300
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,630
Ahsoka, I want to believe
Master Plo's alive,

301
00:16:58,713 --> 00:17:00,380
-but I just--
-I know he's alive!

302
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:02,755
-I can sense it.
-Ahsoka!

303
00:17:02,838 --> 00:17:03,713
[screeching]

304
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:14,296
Sergeant, why are you
so certain no one is coming?

305
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,171
We're just clones, sir.

306
00:17:16,421 --> 00:17:18,380
We're meant to be expendable.

307
00:17:18,463 --> 00:17:19,880
Not to me.

308
00:17:25,505 --> 00:17:27,755
-There they are!
-Ready tow cable.

309
00:17:32,088 --> 00:17:33,296
Cable loaded, master.

310
00:17:47,505 --> 00:17:48,755
[grunting]

311
00:17:49,254 --> 00:17:50,755
Come on, hurry.

312
00:17:51,546 --> 00:17:52,963
Are you okay, Master Plo?

313
00:17:53,838 --> 00:17:55,129
There's someone in the pod.

314
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,922
[coughing]

315
00:18:03,254 --> 00:18:04,797
Will they be all right?

316
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,880
The pressure suits offer some protection,

317
00:18:06,963 --> 00:18:09,463
but they require a medical frigate
for recovery.

318
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,338
I will stabilize them, sir.

319
00:18:11,421 --> 00:18:12,922
Your men are safe now.

320
00:18:14,213 --> 00:18:17,546
Tell me, were there any survivors?

321
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,004
We couldn't find anybody else.

322
00:18:20,421 --> 00:18:23,588
The hunters must have destroyed the rest.

323
00:18:23,838 --> 00:18:26,463
I'm sorry, Master Plo.

324
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:31,088
We tracked the mystery weapon
to this system.

325
00:18:31,588 --> 00:18:34,213
That is when we found out
it was an ion cannon.

326
00:18:34,755 --> 00:18:36,004
An ion cannon?

327
00:18:36,088 --> 00:18:39,588
A weapon that neutralizes
all power to our ships,

328
00:18:39,672 --> 00:18:42,213
leaving the targets defenseless.

329
00:18:44,421 --> 00:18:46,254
There's a massive vessel approaching.

330
00:18:46,338 --> 00:18:49,088
Shut down the power systems
before they detect us.

331
00:18:54,546 --> 00:18:55,505
[beeps]

332
00:18:55,963 --> 00:18:57,088
The droid!

00:19:00,171 --> 00:19:01,296
Sorry, little guy.

00:19:10,213 --> 00:19:13,088
That is one big cruiser-crusher.

337
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,797
There's still no signal
from the pod hunter.

338
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,546
Reduce speed and activate your scanners.

339
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,338
We will find who is responsible.

340
00:19:38,254 --> 00:19:40,088
Hey, what's with the lights?

341
00:19:40,171 --> 00:19:41,672
Power has gone out.

342
00:19:42,088 --> 00:19:45,046
Maybe that ship has returned.
We should get up to the bridge.

00:19:45,129 --> 00:19:46,171
[groans]

344
00:19:46,254 --> 00:19:47,588
You are too weak.

345
00:19:47,672 --> 00:19:49,588
Let me go see what is wrong.

346
00:20:03,213 --> 00:20:05,922
We are picking up
a faint signal from a droid,

347
00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:07,546
not one of ours.

348
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,963
They're right behind us.

349
00:20:09,046 --> 00:20:10,254
[roars]

350
00:20:10,338 --> 00:20:12,338
Move us into attack position.

351
00:20:16,672 --> 00:20:18,505
They're coming back.

352
00:20:18,588 --> 00:20:20,755
Are all the systems shut down?

353
00:20:20,838 --> 00:20:22,380
Is there a problem, sir?

354
00:20:23,004 --> 00:20:25,296
We forgot to shut off the medical droid.

355
00:20:25,922 --> 00:20:27,755
We've got to get the power back on now.

356
00:20:27,838 --> 00:20:29,963
-Can I be of assistance?
-No, thanks.

357
00:20:30,046 --> 00:20:32,046
Just get in the back
and take care of the clones.

358
00:20:32,129 --> 00:20:33,963
That is my programming, sir.

359
00:20:34,046 --> 00:20:35,046
[Anakin] Come on,
we've got to get out of here.

360
00:20:35,129 --> 00:20:36,004
[Ahsoka] I know. I know.

361
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:43,922
Sir, the enemy is attempting to flee
through the debris field.

362
00:20:44,463 --> 00:20:47,713
General, I don't want any witnesses.

363
00:20:47,797 --> 00:20:50,004
Energize plasma rotors.

364
00:20:53,713 --> 00:20:56,963
R2, program the navi-computer.
Be ready to get us out of here.

365
00:20:57,046 --> 00:20:58,713
You forgot. We turned him off.

366
00:20:59,421 --> 00:21:01,129
[beeping]

367
00:21:01,213 --> 00:21:02,838
Koh-to-ya, droid.

368
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:06,421
Target range almost locked, sir.

369
00:21:06,505 --> 00:21:09,088
They're not going to make it.

370
00:21:09,171 --> 00:21:11,129
R2, program the hyperdrive.

371
00:21:11,213 --> 00:21:12,672
[beeps questioningly]

372
00:21:12,755 --> 00:21:14,088
Anywhere. Hurry!

373
00:21:14,171 --> 00:21:16,213
Enemy ship targeted, general.

374
00:21:16,296 --> 00:21:17,380
Fire!

375
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,421
Master?

376
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:51,088
[beeps]

377
00:21:55,713 --> 00:21:56,672
We're clear.

378
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:03,880
[roars]

379
00:22:04,838 --> 00:22:08,004
Now the Republic will learn
of our ion cannon.

380
00:22:16,296 --> 00:22:19,672
Your failure is most unfortunate.

381
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,838
I will have to discuss this
with my master.

382
00:22:25,421 --> 00:22:26,588
-[growls]
-[screams]

383
00:22:26,672 --> 00:22:29,296
-Get back to work.
-Roger, roger. Roger, roger.

384
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:41,838
Thanks for getting us out of there
in one piece, General Skywalker.

385
00:22:41,922 --> 00:22:43,505
You have my Padawan to thank for that.

386
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:46,254
She always said
you guys would pull through.

387
00:22:46,338 --> 00:22:48,546
General Plo said
someone would come for us.

388
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,505
We're glad he was right.

389
00:22:50,588 --> 00:22:54,588
Skywalker, it is time to give our report
to the Council.

390
00:22:54,672 --> 00:22:57,672
Right, the Council report.

391
00:22:57,755 --> 00:22:59,797
[beeps]

392
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,922
Come on, Ahsoka.

393
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,922
You want me there?
I' figured, because of before--

394
00:23:04,004 --> 00:23:06,546
Ahsoka... through it all,
you never gave up.

395
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,296
You did a great job.

396
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:10,630
But if I'm getting in trouble for this,

397
00:23:10,755 --> 00:23:12,421
you're gonna share some of the blame too.

398
00:23:12,505 --> 00:23:15,129
[laughs] So come on. Let's go.

399
00:23:15,963 --> 00:23:17,505
Right beside you, Skyguy.

400
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,880
[beeps]

401
00:23:22,213 --> 00:23:25,088
[orchestral fanfare]

402
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:28,672
