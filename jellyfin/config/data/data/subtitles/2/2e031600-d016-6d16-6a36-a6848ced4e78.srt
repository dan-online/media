00:00:33,683 --> 00:00:36,803
Hello and welcome to Top Gear.

2
00:00:36,803 --> 00:00:37,843
We're back!

3
00:00:40,843 --> 00:00:43,643
This is always my
favourite time of the year.

4
00:00:43,643 --> 00:00:46,003
Everything feels nice and familiar.

5
00:00:46,003 --> 00:00:49,123
The clocks have gone back,
Strictly's on the telly

6
00:00:49,123 --> 00:00:51,603
and Harris has got his autumn
socks on.

7
00:00:51,603 --> 00:00:55,003
100% Merino, Pad.
Anything less - mug's game.

8
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:57,283
It's that time of year, isn't it,
for battening down the hatches

9
00:00:57,283 --> 00:00:59,803
and hunkering down. Oh, I do love a
hunker.

10
00:00:59,803 --> 00:01:03,043
I've heard you in the dressing room.
I've heard you!

11
00:01:03,043 --> 00:01:06,523
And, of course, we've got a
brand-new series of Top Gear.

12
00:01:06,523 --> 00:01:08,003
Take a look at this.

13
00:01:16,403 --> 00:01:17,603
Watch this.

14
00:01:25,123 --> 00:01:26,243
We're going in!

15
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:31,443
I love the fact that it revs to 11!

16
00:01:31,443 --> 00:01:33,243
Love that it goes to 11!

17
00:01:35,723 --> 00:01:37,723
It's like a giant game of Guess
Who, isn't it?

18
00:01:39,043 --> 00:01:40,683
Where's the turn there?

19
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:46,283
Just reminds me of being young
and stupid.

20
00:01:51,643 --> 00:01:53,483
My onions have gone again.

21
00:01:53,483 --> 00:01:55,683
My onions have gone!

22
00:02:01,243 --> 00:02:04,443
Watch this, boys - the transformer.
Are you ready?

23
00:02:22,403 --> 00:02:24,083
It's crazy, that.

24
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:25,643
Oh, my word!

25
00:02:25,643 --> 00:02:28,803
I hope you've got comprehensive
insurance, Paddy.

26
00:02:30,843 --> 00:02:31,883
Whoa!

27
00:02:32,843 --> 00:02:34,763
This is absolutely bonkers.

28
00:02:36,803 --> 00:02:37,843
Ready?

29
00:02:42,003 --> 00:02:43,323
It sort of worked.

30
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:52,043
Exciting!

31
00:02:52,043 --> 00:02:56,283
It's not bad.  The best bunch
of cars we've had in ages.

32
00:02:56,283 --> 00:02:58,123
Real quality.  Yes. Really good.

33
00:02:58,123 --> 00:02:59,763
All that to come.

34
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:02,443
But right now, we've got
a cracking show in store.

35
00:03:02,443 --> 00:03:05,723
Later on, Chris Harris gets
his Merino-woollen mitts

36
00:03:05,723 --> 00:03:09,043
on that battery-powered
beast over there.

37
00:03:10,003 --> 00:03:13,283
But we kick off by talking
about this, the humble

38
00:03:13,283 --> 00:03:15,003
pick-up truck. Fred!

39
00:03:15,003 --> 00:03:16,363
Say some words.

40
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:17,483
I will do that.

41
00:03:17,483 --> 00:03:19,243
Pick-ups are on the rise here
in the UK,

42
00:03:19,243 --> 00:03:21,243
but pretty much everywhere
else on the planet

43
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:22,803
they're already massive news.

44
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:26,043
About 4 million of them are sold
around the world every year.

45
00:03:26,043 --> 00:03:28,483
That's a lot of picking up.

46
00:03:28,483 --> 00:03:31,803
We wanted to dig a little deeper
into this mysterious world,

47
00:03:31,803 --> 00:03:35,403
so we hopped on a flight to the
spiritual home of the pick-up,

48
00:03:35,403 --> 00:03:38,643
which, as it turned out,
wasn't America.

49
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:40,883
Get out!

50
00:03:45,523 --> 00:03:53,043
This is Thailand, home to white sand
beaches, lush jungle

51
00:03:53,043 --> 00:03:56,763
and plenty of pick-up trucks.

52
00:03:58,683 --> 00:04:03,923
Thailand buys more pick-ups per head
than any other country in the world.

53
00:04:06,803 --> 00:04:08,363
And, with a few grand each

54
00:04:08,363 --> 00:04:11,363
to see what we could pick
up on the local market,

55
00:04:11,363 --> 00:04:15,563
let's just say I had absolutely
nailed it.

56
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:21,323
Look at this.

57
00:04:21,323 --> 00:04:23,083
I have not messed about.

58
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,643
I've gone for a Toyota Hilux,

59
00:04:25,643 --> 00:04:27,803
the camel of the car world,

60
00:04:27,803 --> 00:04:31,563
tough as old boots, because you see
round here, pick-ups...

61
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,603
They're not just for delivering
trestle tables

62
00:04:33,603 --> 00:04:35,483
to the local village fete.

63
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:38,883
These get things anywhere
they need to go.

64
00:04:38,883 --> 00:04:42,243
As you can see, this one,
not exactly standard.

65
00:04:42,243 --> 00:04:43,363
It's been raised.

66
00:04:43,363 --> 00:04:46,763
It's got big monster tyres,
got a winch at the front.

67
00:04:46,763 --> 00:04:49,923
This thing has been made
Thailand ready.

68
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:51,723
I've smashed it out of the park.

69
00:04:51,723 --> 00:04:52,883
Jeez!

70
00:04:52,883 --> 00:04:54,603
Not so fast.

71
00:04:55,843 --> 00:04:58,563
Because, if you want a truly
Thai truck,

72
00:04:58,563 --> 00:05:04,723
then look no further
than the Isuzu D-Max.

73
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:06,763
Oh, wow!

74
00:05:07,883 --> 00:05:08,923
Look at this!

75
00:05:10,963 --> 00:05:12,443
Morning.  Good morning.

76
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:17,203
D-Max?  Yes.

77
00:05:17,203 --> 00:05:19,723
Most popular pick-up drop
in Thailand, that.

78
00:05:19,723 --> 00:05:21,763
150,000 sold every year.

79
00:05:21,763 --> 00:05:24,163
This is what they're all about.
This is the culture.

80
00:05:24,163 --> 00:05:25,923
It's a big thing over here -

81
00:05:25,923 --> 00:05:27,403
pimping up your pick-up trucks.

82
00:05:27,403 --> 00:05:29,443
You've got a carbon bonnet pad.
Is that carbon?

83
00:05:29,443 --> 00:05:31,483
Yes, I have. Carbon-wrapped fibre.

84
00:05:31,483 --> 00:05:37,563
Don't ruin the illusion.
Your wheels.  Yes. Have a look in.

85
00:05:37,563 --> 00:05:39,723
Lovely, isn't it? Bucket seats.

86
00:05:39,723 --> 00:05:41,803
Gear stick.  Oh, it's got the lot.

87
00:05:41,803 --> 00:05:45,003
I must admit, I think you've done
all right.  It's what it's all about.

88
00:05:45,003 --> 00:05:46,643
Stands out, doesn't it?

89
00:05:46,643 --> 00:05:52,883
Maybe, but to really appreciate
Thailand's love affair
with the pick-up,

90
00:05:52,883 --> 00:05:55,683
you'll want something
a bit more bespoke.

91
00:05:58,123 --> 00:06:00,523
Ah! I tell you what, bud...

92
00:06:02,163 --> 00:06:04,723
Wow, Chris - an E30 BMW.

93
00:06:04,723 --> 00:06:07,523
What I've done here...
I was just going
to say. Talk us through it.

94
00:06:07,523 --> 00:06:10,763
Well, I mean, come on.
I've taken a lovely old three series

95
00:06:10,763 --> 00:06:12,963
which was nearing the end
of its life

96
00:06:12,963 --> 00:06:15,963
and I've transformed it into a
performance pick-up.

97
00:06:15,963 --> 00:06:18,443
Doesn't it look gorgeous?
I'm just staring at its beauty.

98
00:06:18,443 --> 00:06:21,363
Didn't do it myself - it was a
man here who did it because frankly

99
00:06:21,363 --> 00:06:24,803
they will turn anything into a
pick-up out here and they'll do

100
00:06:24,803 --> 00:06:26,283
it with some style.

101
00:06:26,283 --> 00:06:28,763
It's a beautiful job, all done
locally.

102
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:33,363
Now, obviously, we can see what
you've done to it, OK.

103
00:06:33,363 --> 00:06:37,323
But pick-up trucks essentially are
going to be off-roading.

104
00:06:37,323 --> 00:06:40,363
We can see what you've done.  Whoa!
What can we not see?

105
00:06:40,363 --> 00:06:43,563
What have you done to make
it pick-up-esque underneath?

106
00:06:43,563 --> 00:06:47,003
When you said off-roading...
Yeah.  I'm looking at these cars

107
00:06:47,003 --> 00:06:49,083
and we're very much for
different roads.

108
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,563
You just took a three series...
Yeah.

109
00:06:51,563 --> 00:06:54,843
..cut the back off...
Yeah.  ..that's it.  Yeah.

110
00:06:54,843 --> 00:06:55,883
Wow!

111
00:06:58,683 --> 00:07:03,083
So, with two trucks and a chopped
up Beemer all ready to roll...

112
00:07:05,123 --> 00:07:11,203
..we headed out to discover
what Thailand and its pick-up
obsession was really all about.

113
00:07:20,323 --> 00:07:22,243
I look the Thai culture, lads.

114
00:07:22,243 --> 00:07:25,043
It's very bright and brash
and in your face.

115
00:07:25,043 --> 00:07:27,083
It's a bit of a senses overload.

116
00:07:28,283 --> 00:07:31,803
Anywhere else. If we were driving
around in the UK in this pick-up,

117
00:07:31,803 --> 00:07:33,083
everyone would be looking at it.

118
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:36,643
But over here it's just part
of the furniture.

119
00:07:36,643 --> 00:07:40,323
Do you know what the single most
important law of the road

120
00:07:40,323 --> 00:07:41,563
is over here?

121
00:07:41,563 --> 00:07:45,963
It is actually illegal to drive
without wearing a shirt.

122
00:07:47,043 --> 00:07:50,283
McGuinness, you are, let's say,
pushing it slightly.

123
00:07:54,763 --> 00:07:57,563
Everywhere you look, boys, there's
pick-up trucks.

124
00:07:58,523 --> 00:08:01,603
Thailand really is the pick-up
capital of the world.

125
00:08:01,603 --> 00:08:05,483
It's known as the Detroit
of the Far East because they build

126
00:08:05,483 --> 00:08:09,043
so many of the things, literally
millions a year.

127
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,123
Look at this coming through.

128
00:08:17,523 --> 00:08:19,603
It's outrageous.

129
00:08:19,603 --> 00:08:22,003
That is ridiculously overloaded.

130
00:08:24,563 --> 00:08:29,563
Now, to put our pick-ups to the
test, we've been told to head north

131
00:08:29,563 --> 00:08:31,843
towards the capital, Bangkok.

132
00:08:32,883 --> 00:08:37,843
From there, we'd be striking out
deep into Thailand's rural interior.

133
00:08:39,763 --> 00:08:42,243
What that would mean for my
low-slung Beemer

134
00:08:42,243 --> 00:08:44,243
we'd have to wait and see,

135
00:08:44,243 --> 00:08:47,483
but so far it was looking
very good indeed.

136
00:08:49,043 --> 00:08:54,283
If you want quality and durability,
go mid-'80s Germany.

137
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:57,963
I mean, this must be a
40-year-old car

138
00:08:57,963 --> 00:09:00,003
and it's superb.

139
00:09:00,003 --> 00:09:01,483
The trim's in great condition.

140
00:09:01,483 --> 00:09:03,083
I've got the optional sport seats.

141
00:09:04,403 --> 00:09:08,043
Still think that if BMW made a car
that looked like this now

142
00:09:08,043 --> 00:09:10,163
it'd be a runaway best-seller.

143
00:09:11,203 --> 00:09:16,243
Especially as BMW already knows
exactly how to build one.

144
00:09:18,483 --> 00:09:22,563
Behold the original E30 pick-up.

145
00:09:25,163 --> 00:09:28,163
Built back in the mid-'80s
to haul parts around the factory

146
00:09:28,163 --> 00:09:32,803
at BMW's slightly unhinged,
high-performance M Division,

147
00:09:32,803 --> 00:09:36,643
it was surely the coolest
pick-up truck in history.

148
00:09:40,123 --> 00:09:45,763
And now, thanks to some genius local
workmanship, there's another one.

149
00:09:46,883 --> 00:09:49,443
I've not budgeted for tarmac
as good as this.

150
00:09:49,443 --> 00:09:52,043
You must be loving life
in yours, Chris.

151
00:09:52,043 --> 00:09:55,043
Lovely BMW, straight six.
It's all familiar in here.

152
00:09:55,043 --> 00:09:57,083
Yeah, she just cruises along.

153
00:09:57,083 --> 00:09:58,603
I don't want to burst your bubble,

154
00:09:58,603 --> 00:10:02,003
but whatever the road throws
at me in this, I'm ready for.

155
00:10:02,003 --> 00:10:03,043
Anything!

156
00:10:06,323 --> 00:10:09,283
These days, everyone's rolling round
in SUVs,

157
00:10:09,283 --> 00:10:14,803
but I've Got to ask, what does an
Audi Q7 give you that this doesn't?

158
00:10:14,803 --> 00:10:18,043
I'm up high. I can see everything.

159
00:10:18,043 --> 00:10:21,163
Now, it's a bit tatty inside,
but it's going to be.

160
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:23,323
These are workhorses.

161
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:27,763
And don't forget, this workhorse
is a Hilux.

162
00:10:27,763 --> 00:10:30,323
Over 50 years
they've been building these.

163
00:10:30,323 --> 00:10:35,203
Selling 18 million of them to every
corner of the globe.

164
00:10:35,203 --> 00:10:37,723
It's 20 years old, this car.

165
00:10:37,723 --> 00:10:41,323
207,000 kilometres, it'll
go forever.

166
00:10:42,523 --> 00:10:43,683
Maybe it will.

167
00:10:44,763 --> 00:10:48,923
But in Thailand, they have
different priorities.

168
00:10:51,243 --> 00:10:54,283
If you go to Holland, you'll
expect to see a bicycle.

169
00:10:54,283 --> 00:10:58,723
Come to Thailand and expect to see
a D-Max.

170
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:03,363
It was made here, it was
launched here.

171
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:05,003
And it's capable.

172
00:11:05,003 --> 00:11:06,643
It's practical.

173
00:11:06,643 --> 00:11:09,443
The white T-shirt of the
pick-up world.

174
00:11:09,443 --> 00:11:12,403
Everyone's got one, and they do
the job.

175
00:11:12,403 --> 00:11:14,723
And like any white T-shirt,

176
00:11:14,723 --> 00:11:16,883
there's always room for improvement.

177
00:11:16,883 --> 00:11:20,563
A bit of glitter, a few
sequins sewn on.

178
00:11:20,563 --> 00:11:22,203
Really pimp 'em up.

179
00:11:23,723 --> 00:11:26,323
And to make that very point,

180
00:11:26,323 --> 00:11:29,963
we were soon told to stop off
at a nearby circuit

181
00:11:29,963 --> 00:11:34,203
where we'd be getting a taste
of how the locals go racing.

182
00:11:35,483 --> 00:11:36,843
Look at this.

183
00:11:38,403 --> 00:11:40,083
Oh, wow!

184
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,563
That is mega.

185
00:11:43,963 --> 00:11:46,683
Look at the trucks coming through,
look at these.

186
00:11:46,683 --> 00:11:48,723
Oh, D-Maxs, lads.

187
00:11:48,723 --> 00:11:52,283
I told you, they absolutely
love 'em round here.

188
00:11:52,283 --> 00:11:54,523
What a little circuit.

189
00:11:54,523 --> 00:11:57,763
Set on the edge of the Kaeng Krachan
National Park,

190
00:11:57,763 --> 00:12:02,283
the KK Circuit is surely one
of the more spectacular tracks

191
00:12:02,283 --> 00:12:04,843
that the world of motorsport
has to offer.

192
00:12:07,203 --> 00:12:08,843
This is nice, Chris, innit?

193
00:12:08,843 --> 00:12:10,203
Look at this.

194
00:12:10,203 --> 00:12:11,323
What a track.

195
00:12:12,963 --> 00:12:15,003
But better still,
it plays host

196
00:12:15,003 --> 00:12:17,963
to one of Thailand's
favourite race series.

197
00:12:19,683 --> 00:12:23,803
Diesel D-Maxs tuned to over
300 horsepower

198
00:12:23,803 --> 00:12:28,883
going wheel to wheel in a fully
fledged pick-up truck championship.

199
00:12:36,363 --> 00:12:38,123
CHRIS COUGHS AND SPLUTTERS

200
00:12:38,123 --> 00:12:39,603
Wowsers.

201
00:12:39,603 --> 00:12:41,683
ENGINES ROAR

202
00:12:41,683 --> 00:12:43,483
Sound a bit different to yours, Pad.

203
00:12:43,483 --> 00:12:46,203
Yeah.  Don't they?  Yeah. THEY LAUGH

204
00:12:46,203 --> 00:12:48,603
We weren't just here to
watch, though.

205
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:52,683
No. To give us the full performance
pick-up experience,

206
00:12:52,683 --> 00:12:57,043
we'd been invited to take part
in our own special relay race.

207
00:12:58,123 --> 00:13:00,083
Each paired with a local pro

208
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:02,043
whose first job was to jump

209
00:13:02,043 --> 00:13:03,603
on board our pick-ups

210
00:13:03,603 --> 00:13:05,003
to give us a quick look

211
00:13:05,003 --> 00:13:06,283
at the track.

212
00:13:06,283 --> 00:13:07,763
Here we go.

213
00:13:07,763 --> 00:13:12,683
A ride, it would be fair to say,
some enjoyed more than others.

214
00:13:12,683 --> 00:13:15,123
TYRES SCREECH

215
00:13:15,123 --> 00:13:17,363
CHEERING

216
00:13:19,603 --> 00:13:21,283
Right line?  Right line.

217
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:24,563
Whoa!

218
00:13:26,483 --> 00:13:28,203
LAUGHING

219
00:13:31,203 --> 00:13:33,563
Whoa.

220
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:35,083
TYRES SCREECH

221
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:38,083
LAUGHING The back wheel came up.

222
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,763
Whoa!

223
00:13:40,763 --> 00:13:43,523
Whoa! Whoa!

224
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,203
CHRIS LAUGHS Wow!

225
00:13:45,203 --> 00:13:46,763
I think he likes the drift.

226
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:54,843
With the pre-race entertainment done
with, it was relay time.

227
00:13:56,203 --> 00:14:00,523
Having each been lent one of our
team-mates' spare trucks to run in,

228
00:14:00,523 --> 00:14:03,803
the race itself would be fought over
two stints,

229
00:14:03,803 --> 00:14:07,443
each with a grid of six cars.

230
00:14:07,443 --> 00:14:11,683
Our team-mates would be up first,
battling for four laps

231
00:14:11,683 --> 00:14:14,523
to put us in the best position
they could

232
00:14:14,523 --> 00:14:17,043
to then take on our own set
of pros

233
00:14:17,043 --> 00:14:20,283
in another four lap run
to the finish.

234
00:14:21,363 --> 00:14:24,523
My lad, Pete, he's all over it,
he loves it.

235
00:14:24,523 --> 00:14:26,123
This is your lad, 68.

236
00:14:27,483 --> 00:14:29,403
Come on, boss.

237
00:14:29,403 --> 00:14:30,643
There's my lad.

238
00:14:30,643 --> 00:14:31,963
Sarun. He's called Sarun.

239
00:14:31,963 --> 00:14:33,203
He's in Tommy.

240
00:14:33,203 --> 00:14:34,563
Bit confusing.  You what?

241
00:14:34,563 --> 00:14:36,083
That's... He's called Sarun,

242
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,123
his car's got the name Tommy
on the side.

243
00:14:38,123 --> 00:14:40,483
He's not called Tommy.  Is his car
called Tommy?

244
00:14:40,483 --> 00:14:42,403
His car's called Tommy.
Who's called Tommy?

245
00:14:42,403 --> 00:14:44,363
The car.

246
00:14:44,363 --> 00:14:48,443
So, our first pick-up race was on.

247
00:14:51,283 --> 00:14:52,843
Go on, Sarun!

248
00:14:58,443 --> 00:14:59,603
They shift, don't they?

249
00:14:59,603 --> 00:15:02,323
And it looks easy from out here.
I don't think it's so easy in there.

250
00:15:02,323 --> 00:15:03,923
I don't think it looks easy, Chris.

251
00:15:03,923 --> 00:15:06,243
No, I don't know what
you're watching, Chris.

252
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,843
Can I make a prediction here, Paddy?

253
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,443
We're going to be fifth and sixth.

254
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:22,043
Come on, Tommy!

255
00:15:22,043 --> 00:15:23,563
Wind it up, son!

256
00:15:28,563 --> 00:15:30,163
Are you at the front, Fred?  Second.

257
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,843
Second, Chris, I'm third.

258
00:15:31,843 --> 00:15:35,243
You're lad is racing the race of his
life here.  Shut up.

259
00:15:35,243 --> 00:15:37,923
He's going to get out to you and go,
"Carry on."

260
00:15:40,123 --> 00:15:42,883
Oh! He nearly had the back end
out then.

261
00:15:45,643 --> 00:15:48,603
With the pros now fighting
over the last lap,

262
00:15:48,603 --> 00:15:50,483
we headed for our race trucks...

263
00:15:51,563 --> 00:15:54,283
..and got ready to take
to the track.

264
00:15:55,283 --> 00:15:56,883
Wow, it's hot in here.

265
00:15:58,883 --> 00:16:02,003
McGuinness's would be handing
over to him in fourth,

266
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,843
mine second,

267
00:16:03,843 --> 00:16:05,883
while Harris's...

268
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:07,763
Bloody hell, I'm in first.

269
00:16:07,763 --> 00:16:09,283
What a drive.

270
00:16:09,283 --> 00:16:11,883
..had landed him in the lead.

271
00:16:11,883 --> 00:16:13,403
I'm off. And we're off.

272
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:17,163
Come on!

273
00:16:17,163 --> 00:16:22,763
Six cars, four laps, and we were off
to a flying start.

274
00:16:22,763 --> 00:16:25,643
This is a very intimidating vehicle.

275
00:16:25,643 --> 00:16:29,003
Might have bit off more than I can
chew here.

276
00:16:29,003 --> 00:16:31,923
Although one of us would probably
have liked

277
00:16:31,923 --> 00:16:35,163
a slightly smoother take-off.

278
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:36,843
Oh, he's away here, Chris Harris.

279
00:16:36,843 --> 00:16:39,163
How am I going to keep
with this lad?

280
00:16:39,163 --> 00:16:41,603
TYRES SCREECH

281
00:16:45,523 --> 00:16:49,043
There's an off straight away.
Is that Flintoff?

282
00:16:49,043 --> 00:16:50,483
Get back out.

283
00:16:52,283 --> 00:16:53,643
Wow, that was different.

284
00:16:53,643 --> 00:16:55,003
This is sketchy.

285
00:16:56,603 --> 00:16:58,363
What is this I'm driving?

286
00:16:58,363 --> 00:17:01,203
I've spun out on the first corner.

287
00:17:01,203 --> 00:17:05,443
To be fair, though, up at the front,
even our best driver

288
00:17:05,443 --> 00:17:08,203
was finding his truck
tricky to master.

289
00:17:09,643 --> 00:17:11,883
TYRES SCREECH

290
00:17:11,883 --> 00:17:13,203
Brakes are terrible.

291
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,123
This thing, I know it just looks
like a pick-up to you,

292
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:20,283
but it's one of the most difficult
cars I've ever driven.

293
00:17:22,723 --> 00:17:24,323
Oh, too much, too much, too much.

294
00:17:24,323 --> 00:17:26,043
Take it off a bit.

295
00:17:26,043 --> 00:17:27,243
Wow!

296
00:17:27,243 --> 00:17:29,523
Whoa, Fred, nice and easy.

297
00:17:34,643 --> 00:17:38,083
Is he catching me? I'm not sure
he is.

298
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,163
Despite his teething troubles,

299
00:17:40,163 --> 00:17:43,523
Harris was keeping the second place
pro at bay

300
00:17:43,523 --> 00:17:47,243
and was looking nailed on
for the win.

301
00:17:47,243 --> 00:17:48,803
Come on!

302
00:17:48,803 --> 00:17:50,683
But as the laps ticked away...

303
00:17:50,683 --> 00:17:52,163
Yeah, baby!

304
00:17:53,163 --> 00:17:55,203
Two to go, come on.

305
00:17:55,203 --> 00:17:58,043
..Flintoff was getting his eye in.

306
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:00,403
Get round. Get round.

307
00:18:02,883 --> 00:18:04,923
Oh, nice, Fred.

308
00:18:04,923 --> 00:18:10,323
And that meant this race was now
all about the battle for third.

309
00:18:11,403 --> 00:18:13,603
Gaining on Paddy's tail here.

310
00:18:13,603 --> 00:18:15,843
Oh, he'll be feeling it now.

311
00:18:15,843 --> 00:18:18,443
Oh, Paddy, I'm going to make you
make a mistake here.

312
00:18:26,203 --> 00:18:28,523
Whoa! Smokey Joe!

313
00:18:29,683 --> 00:18:31,883
Power, power, power, power, power.

314
00:18:36,643 --> 00:18:37,843
Come on, old girl!

315
00:18:38,963 --> 00:18:40,323
Come on!

316
00:18:42,123 --> 00:18:43,443
Victory!

317
00:18:45,963 --> 00:18:48,163
Get out, get out, get out.

318
00:18:48,163 --> 00:18:49,323
Let's go.

319
00:18:49,323 --> 00:18:51,243
Keep going. Come on, Fred.

320
00:18:51,243 --> 00:18:52,603
Here we go.

321
00:18:52,603 --> 00:18:54,363
Woo!

322
00:18:54,363 --> 00:18:57,123
Chequered flag, over we go.

323
00:18:57,123 --> 00:18:58,963
He got me.

324
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:05,883
So, there we have it, our first
taste of Thai pick-up racing.

325
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:08,843
And given our usual track record
with this sort of thing,

326
00:19:08,843 --> 00:19:12,683
we had to chalk it up as a
surprise success.

327
00:19:12,683 --> 00:19:14,203
Number one?

328
00:19:14,203 --> 00:19:15,523
Well done, Christopher.

329
00:19:15,523 --> 00:19:18,843
But I am absolutely...
Well done.  ..rooted.

330
00:19:18,843 --> 00:19:21,523
I don't advise racing
in the tropics.

331
00:19:21,523 --> 00:19:24,003
Hey.  Thanks, Pete.  Thank you.
Well done, lads.  Well done.

332
00:19:24,003 --> 00:19:26,563
You were wicked.  I tell you what...
Thanks for letting us loose.

333
00:19:26,563 --> 00:19:29,083
..these...  We love 'em.  I have a
new-found respect for the D-Max.

334
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,923
Yeah, amazing.  Fantastic.
Is it the power?

335
00:19:30,923 --> 00:19:33,683
The power is amazing.
The brakes are not amazing.

336
00:19:33,683 --> 00:19:36,043
The brakes are either all on
or nothing.

337
00:19:36,043 --> 00:19:38,123
But the real winner is the circuit.

338
00:19:38,123 --> 00:19:39,803
The circuit is the best.

339
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,443
Amazing.  Fantastic.

340
00:19:48,843 --> 00:19:51,443
It was time to get back on the
road north

341
00:19:51,443 --> 00:19:54,843
and see what else we could pick up
about Thailand

342
00:19:54,843 --> 00:19:58,363
as we headed towards Bangkok.

343
00:20:05,523 --> 00:20:07,763
Dear God, have a look at this.

344
00:20:09,003 --> 00:20:11,003
That has got to be so heavy.

345
00:20:12,043 --> 00:20:16,323
The chassis is bowing in the middle
and there's two lads sitting on top.

346
00:20:16,323 --> 00:20:20,283
It's bent that much he can't even
shut his driver's door properly.

347
00:20:21,443 --> 00:20:24,043
In my many years of travelling
the globe,

348
00:20:24,043 --> 00:20:27,003
that is the ropiest thing
I've seen car-wise.

349
00:20:44,283 --> 00:20:46,083
Look at the vista, lads.

350
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,923
Welcome to Bangkok.

351
00:20:59,683 --> 00:21:01,563
You must have been there
before, Chris.

352
00:21:01,563 --> 00:21:04,243
Did you not have a gap year
when you was at uni?

353
00:21:04,243 --> 00:21:07,003
I might have had a gap year.
Did you?

354
00:21:07,003 --> 00:21:09,563
Did you spend it in Thailand?

355
00:21:09,563 --> 00:21:10,843
No, I did not.

356
00:21:10,843 --> 00:21:14,243
I went to Africa to teach,
actually, Andrew.

357
00:21:14,243 --> 00:21:16,123
POSH ACCENT:  I went and
found myself.

358
00:21:16,123 --> 00:21:18,603
I-I just went over.
It was AMAZING.

359
00:21:20,243 --> 00:21:22,083
What did you do, rob shops?

360
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,363
HE CHUCKLES

361
00:21:27,163 --> 00:21:29,803
Lads, now we're in our first
bit of traffic,

362
00:21:29,803 --> 00:21:32,323
coming into the heart of the city,

363
00:21:32,323 --> 00:21:36,483
last night I was doing a bit
of research on the old Internet,

364
00:21:36,483 --> 00:21:37,843
Googling Bangkok,

365
00:21:37,843 --> 00:21:41,723
and I've found us a very,
very interesting

366
00:21:41,723 --> 00:21:43,043
back street venue.

367
00:21:44,283 --> 00:21:46,483
Remember, delete history, Patrick.

368
00:21:47,923 --> 00:21:49,243
No need for that.

369
00:21:49,243 --> 00:21:53,923
Because what I'd actually
found was pick-up paradise.

370
00:22:01,923 --> 00:22:03,723
What've we got here, Pad?

371
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:05,683
D-Max nirvana.

372
00:22:05,683 --> 00:22:10,523
This is the Mecca for all
things pick-up.

373
00:22:10,523 --> 00:22:12,043
Oh!

374
00:22:12,043 --> 00:22:13,723
Fellow D-Maxer there.

375
00:22:13,723 --> 00:22:15,443
Look at these D-Max, lads.

376
00:22:15,443 --> 00:22:17,083
Look at this!

377
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:19,763
I think they've even got you covered
here, Paddy, with graphics.

378
00:22:19,763 --> 00:22:21,243
Look at that one.

379
00:22:21,243 --> 00:22:22,363
How many turbochargers?

380
00:22:22,363 --> 00:22:26,403
That one's got two massive
blowers on it.

381
00:22:26,403 --> 00:22:28,963
Look at this, it goes all the way
around here.

382
00:22:28,963 --> 00:22:31,243
It carries on going.
There's everything.

383
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:35,723
I'll tell you what, this makes
me feel a bit wistful for my past,

384
00:22:35,723 --> 00:22:37,603
for the max power years.

385
00:22:37,603 --> 00:22:40,403
When I was younger, I couldn't leave
stuff alone.

386
00:22:40,403 --> 00:22:42,923
If I bought a car, I had to
add the bits -

387
00:22:42,923 --> 00:22:45,843
the fancy Hi-Fi, the rims,
the lowering kit.

388
00:22:45,843 --> 00:22:49,363
It's just... It's a... It's a rite
of passage, isn't it?

389
00:22:49,363 --> 00:22:51,883
You want to just add things.

390
00:22:51,883 --> 00:22:54,043
Got to say, Pad, when I saw
your pick-up,

391
00:22:54,043 --> 00:22:56,363
I thought, "That's a
bit much, that."

392
00:22:56,363 --> 00:22:59,283
However, I get it now. I get it.

393
00:22:59,283 --> 00:23:02,003
Good Lord, I could waste days here.

394
00:23:04,803 --> 00:23:08,123
But the market was only the warm up.

395
00:23:08,123 --> 00:23:09,963
And just around the corner,

396
00:23:09,963 --> 00:23:14,763
we found some of Thailand's proper
max power petrolheads.

397
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,043
Wowsers.

398
00:23:19,043 --> 00:23:21,923
Check out the metal here.

399
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:27,003
Look at that Lotus.

400
00:23:27,003 --> 00:23:28,203
Wow!

401
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:33,643
Look at these.

402
00:23:36,763 --> 00:23:40,483
That might be the fastest Jazz
I've ever seen in my life.

403
00:23:40,483 --> 00:23:44,083
Turns out Bangkok isn't
just mad for mods, though.

404
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:46,123
This is mega!

405
00:23:46,123 --> 00:23:49,243
They also love a bit of drifting.

406
00:23:51,923 --> 00:23:53,123
Oh!

407
00:23:53,123 --> 00:23:54,323
Yes!

408
00:23:54,323 --> 00:23:56,083
Look at this behind. Look at this.

409
00:24:01,243 --> 00:24:03,883
Now, this was what we'd come to see.

410
00:24:05,203 --> 00:24:08,803
Another corner of the world
completely mad for tuning

411
00:24:08,803 --> 00:24:10,523
and tyre smoke.

412
00:24:22,763 --> 00:24:24,083
Fantastic.

413
00:24:25,163 --> 00:24:28,163
To get the full Thai
drift experience, though...

414
00:24:28,163 --> 00:24:29,723
Come on, then, McGuinness.

415
00:24:29,723 --> 00:24:32,963
..we nominated our
D-Max correspondent

416
00:24:32,963 --> 00:24:35,203
to go along for the ride.

417
00:24:35,203 --> 00:24:36,963
He's going to love this.

418
00:24:36,963 --> 00:24:38,723
He's going to love this.

419
00:24:38,723 --> 00:24:40,163
Here we go.

420
00:24:40,163 --> 00:24:41,643
I'm Christy.

421
00:24:41,643 --> 00:24:44,203
Hi, Christy.  Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

422
00:24:44,203 --> 00:24:45,643
Er, where are we?

423
00:24:45,643 --> 00:24:47,883
Sorry, there's no belt for you.

424
00:24:47,883 --> 00:24:49,843
THUD Oops!  Oh, my God.

425
00:24:49,843 --> 00:24:51,443
Yep, no belts,

426
00:24:51,443 --> 00:24:53,923
lots of exposed metal.

427
00:24:53,923 --> 00:24:56,003
ENGINE REVS Kids,

428
00:24:56,003 --> 00:24:58,483
do NOT try this at home.

429
00:25:05,043 --> 00:25:07,283
PADDY SCREAMS

430
00:25:12,563 --> 00:25:13,843
Whoa!

431
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:19,323
Ha-ha!

432
00:25:21,763 --> 00:25:23,483
HE SCREAMS

433
00:25:26,123 --> 00:25:28,123
Oh, my God!

434
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:42,763
Nicely done.

435
00:25:42,763 --> 00:25:44,723
SHE LAUGHS

436
00:25:44,723 --> 00:25:46,403
Right.

437
00:25:46,403 --> 00:25:50,403
I'm going to find a little spot
to...lie down and have a cry.

438
00:25:51,403 --> 00:25:53,003
SHE LAUGHS Is he OK?

439
00:25:53,003 --> 00:25:54,723
Oh.

440
00:25:54,723 --> 00:25:56,003
Wowsers.

441
00:25:57,683 --> 00:26:00,163
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

442
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:04,803
Did you enjoy it?

443
00:26:07,443 --> 00:26:11,363
So, Pad, how did you enjoy your
first experience

444
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:13,563
of the Zed drift scene?

445
00:26:13,563 --> 00:26:15,283
Well, schoolboy error,

446
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:18,123
I had a Thai green curry
before I got in the car

447
00:26:18,123 --> 00:26:21,163
and I just felt extremely queasy.

448
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:22,843
Everything was spinning, hot sweats.

449
00:26:22,843 --> 00:26:24,923
But I wasn't on my own...
No, you weren't, Pads.

450
00:26:24,923 --> 00:26:27,443
As the day went on, I was getting
rougher and rougher.

451
00:26:27,443 --> 00:26:28,843
Did you have the curry, as well?

452
00:26:28,843 --> 00:26:30,923
Oh, no, worse than that,
I got Covid.

453
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,963
Oh!  Again. Again. CROWD GROANS

454
00:26:32,963 --> 00:26:35,243
I spent the rest of the trip holed
up in a hotel room,

455
00:26:35,243 --> 00:26:37,443
sweating and shivering,
browsing the web.

456
00:26:37,443 --> 00:26:38,843
I bet you did.

457
00:26:38,843 --> 00:26:40,803
LAUGHING

458
00:26:40,803 --> 00:26:42,923
Well, there's plenty more of
Thailand still to see,

459
00:26:42,923 --> 00:26:45,003
and we'll get back to it later on in
the show.

460
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:48,683
But first, there's a shiny
new electric supercar on the scene,

461
00:26:48,683 --> 00:26:51,643
and we told Chris Harris to pop
on his rubber wellies

462
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:53,043
and go check it out.

463
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:04,803
Here it is.

464
00:27:04,803 --> 00:27:07,523
It's called the Nevera.

465
00:27:07,523 --> 00:27:10,043
It's powered by electricity.

466
00:27:10,043 --> 00:27:13,123
And it doesn't come from Italy,

467
00:27:13,123 --> 00:27:14,603
or Germany,

468
00:27:14,603 --> 00:27:15,843
or Britain,

469
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:17,403
or Japan,

470
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:19,483
or even America.

471
00:27:19,483 --> 00:27:22,003
No, the Nevera comes...

472
00:27:23,043 --> 00:27:24,323
..from Croatia.

473
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:33,443
Now, Croatia.

474
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:36,683
Lovely place, cracking
seafood scene,

475
00:27:36,683 --> 00:27:40,523
but not one with any history
of building fast cars

476
00:27:40,523 --> 00:27:44,283
or any history of building any cars.

477
00:27:44,283 --> 00:27:49,123
But this Nevera could be the car
to put Croatia on the car map

478
00:27:49,123 --> 00:27:54,243
because it's built by a company
called Rimac.

479
00:27:54,243 --> 00:27:56,803
Rimac's barely a decade old,

480
00:27:56,803 --> 00:28:00,003
but it's already worked its
electric wizardry

481
00:28:00,003 --> 00:28:02,763
for the likes of Porsche,
Aston Martin,

482
00:28:02,763 --> 00:28:05,643
Ferrari and Koenigsegg.

483
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:09,803
Last year, it took control
of Bugatti.

484
00:28:09,803 --> 00:28:12,803
In short, Rimac means business.

485
00:28:12,803 --> 00:28:17,683
And with the Nevera, it's very much
going it alone.

486
00:28:17,683 --> 00:28:21,643
See, normally if you're a start up
carmaker,

487
00:28:21,643 --> 00:28:24,483
you buy all your bits off the shelf.

488
00:28:24,483 --> 00:28:28,163
You get your headlights from Ford,
steering wheel from Volvo,

489
00:28:28,163 --> 00:28:29,843
engine from GM,

490
00:28:29,843 --> 00:28:32,923
and then you wrap it all in some
fancy new bodywork.

491
00:28:34,683 --> 00:28:36,883
But Rimac hasn't done that.

492
00:28:39,163 --> 00:28:42,523
The Nevera is built completely
from scratch.

493
00:28:43,643 --> 00:28:47,443
The only bits this car shares
with any other on the planet

494
00:28:47,443 --> 00:28:51,203
are the tyres and a few bits
of the aircon.

495
00:28:52,603 --> 00:28:56,523
Everything else - battery,
motors, software,

496
00:28:56,523 --> 00:29:00,923
single piece carbon fibre
chassis - is bespoke.

497
00:29:05,283 --> 00:29:09,243
As business plans go, that's like
opening your own pizzeria

498
00:29:09,243 --> 00:29:12,363
and decided that instead of buying
in any ingredients,

499
00:29:12,363 --> 00:29:15,723
you'll grow your own wheat,
your tomatoes,

500
00:29:15,723 --> 00:29:18,683
your pineapple, your buffalo.

501
00:29:18,683 --> 00:29:23,283
I mean, it's a ruinously stupid
idea, and it's why no-one does it.

502
00:29:23,283 --> 00:29:26,443
But somehow Rimac has made it work.

503
00:29:28,403 --> 00:29:30,123
And more remarkable still...

504
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:35,283
..they've actually made it
rather well.

505
00:29:35,283 --> 00:29:36,723
It's comfy in here.

506
00:29:36,723 --> 00:29:38,323
I mean, the seat's pretty good,

507
00:29:38,323 --> 00:29:41,083
everything's covered in
expensive materials,

508
00:29:41,083 --> 00:29:43,883
I can see out of the thing
perfectly well.

509
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:46,683
I mean, I wouldn't call it a
luxury motorcar,

510
00:29:46,683 --> 00:29:49,683
but it's beautifully built.

511
00:29:49,683 --> 00:29:52,083
And it's practical-ish.

512
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:56,323
I mean, it's fitted with the largest
battery of any electric vehicle,

513
00:29:56,323 --> 00:30:00,003
so it'll do 300 miles on a
single charge.

514
00:30:00,003 --> 00:30:03,603
As products from companies
you've never heard of go,

515
00:30:03,603 --> 00:30:06,683
it's all very convincing.

516
00:30:06,683 --> 00:30:09,883
How much they want you to pay
for it, on the other hand,

517
00:30:09,883 --> 00:30:13,443
might take a little more convincing.

518
00:30:13,443 --> 00:30:16,163
Because this upstart costs -

519
00:30:16,163 --> 00:30:17,323
wait for it -

520
00:30:17,323 --> 00:30:19,803
£2 million.

521
00:30:19,803 --> 00:30:21,563
Now, that's not Ferrari money,

522
00:30:21,563 --> 00:30:23,643
that's not even Lamborghini money,

523
00:30:23,643 --> 00:30:25,403
that's Bugatti money.

524
00:30:25,403 --> 00:30:27,403
It's private jet money.

525
00:30:27,403 --> 00:30:29,723
That's... That's punchy.

526
00:30:32,763 --> 00:30:36,323
Luckily, the Nevera does
have a little trick up its sleeve

527
00:30:36,323 --> 00:30:41,283
that might go some way to justifying
its enormous price tag.

528
00:30:41,283 --> 00:30:47,243
A little trick that requires
a rather long runway to demonstrate.

529
00:30:47,243 --> 00:30:49,883
Now, I probably should have
mentioned this earlier,

530
00:30:49,883 --> 00:30:54,443
but even by conventional supercar
standards, the Nevera is...

531
00:30:54,443 --> 00:30:56,443
It's quite powerful.

532
00:30:56,443 --> 00:30:59,523
You see, it's got one electric motor
for each wheel,

533
00:30:59,523 --> 00:31:04,443
combined power output just under
2,000 horsepower.

534
00:31:05,523 --> 00:31:07,803
That is a lot.

535
00:31:09,363 --> 00:31:11,483
So, what does it feel like?

536
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:26,803
Oh, my Lord.

537
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:30,603
That's 100.

538
00:31:31,843 --> 00:31:33,403
130.

539
00:31:33,403 --> 00:31:35,363
150.

540
00:31:35,363 --> 00:31:37,203
170.

541
00:31:37,203 --> 00:31:38,403
This is ridiculous.

542
00:31:38,403 --> 00:31:39,723
190.

543
00:31:39,723 --> 00:31:42,363
That's 200. She's still pulling.

544
00:31:42,363 --> 00:31:44,963
That's 211, 212.

545
00:31:47,203 --> 00:31:51,963
Right, that is absolutely
mind scramblingly fast.

546
00:31:55,403 --> 00:31:57,283
Good Lord!

547
00:31:57,283 --> 00:32:01,083
That's not driving, that's an
out-of-body experience.

548
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:07,283
In fact, the Nevera accelerates
to 60mph in under 2 seconds.

549
00:32:07,283 --> 00:32:11,203
And whereas electric cars up to
now have always run out of puff

550
00:32:11,203 --> 00:32:13,883
the further north of 100 they go,

551
00:32:13,883 --> 00:32:19,083
this car is limited to 219.

552
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:21,403
Now, what we need here is a bit
of context.

553
00:32:21,403 --> 00:32:26,043
To my left, we have a
Lamborghini Aventador SVJ.

554
00:32:26,043 --> 00:32:27,963
ENGINE REVS

555
00:32:27,963 --> 00:32:29,443
By any standards,

556
00:32:29,443 --> 00:32:31,083
a very, very fast car.

557
00:32:34,443 --> 00:32:35,963
Watch what happens now.

558
00:32:35,963 --> 00:32:38,083
LAMBORGHINI ENGINE REVS

559
00:32:39,523 --> 00:32:42,763
Three, two, one, go!

560
00:32:42,763 --> 00:32:44,043
Bye-bye.

561
00:32:46,283 --> 00:32:47,843
Just disappearing.

562
00:32:49,363 --> 00:32:51,323
I can't begin to describe...

563
00:32:51,323 --> 00:32:53,643
He's not even there, he's gone.

564
00:32:56,563 --> 00:32:59,083
I can barely see him in my mirror.

565
00:33:02,763 --> 00:33:04,083
Over the line.

566
00:33:07,763 --> 00:33:10,523
That spec in the mirror
that I can hardly see

567
00:33:10,523 --> 00:33:13,483
is one of the fastest
Lamborghinis ever made.

568
00:33:17,283 --> 00:33:19,843
It's not... It's not a beating,
it's a mauling.

569
00:33:22,843 --> 00:33:25,643
Tell you what, the old guard better
get ready for it,

570
00:33:25,643 --> 00:33:28,683
cos this is... This is all new
for me.

571
00:33:28,683 --> 00:33:30,643
It's all new for everyone.

572
00:33:31,923 --> 00:33:34,603
The remarkable thing about
the Nevera

573
00:33:34,603 --> 00:33:38,763
isn't that it's the fastest
accelerating road car ever built,

574
00:33:38,763 --> 00:33:43,003
it's the sheer scale of the leap
in performances made.

575
00:33:45,603 --> 00:33:47,003
Round two.

576
00:33:47,003 --> 00:33:49,643
Let's give the Aventador
a better chance this time.

577
00:33:49,643 --> 00:33:52,163
It's 300 metres up the runway

578
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:55,243
and we're going to run
over a standing mile.

579
00:33:56,403 --> 00:33:57,443
Watch this.

580
00:33:59,163 --> 00:34:01,003
ENGINE REVS

581
00:34:06,763 --> 00:34:10,323
Three, two, one, go!

582
00:34:10,323 --> 00:34:11,723
Here we go.

583
00:34:11,723 --> 00:34:13,123
It can't do it, can it?

584
00:34:13,123 --> 00:34:16,043
How can it possibly catch
that Lamborghini?

585
00:34:18,963 --> 00:34:20,163
We're catching it.

586
00:34:21,843 --> 00:34:23,643
We're catching it.

587
00:34:23,643 --> 00:34:25,883
I can't believe this.

588
00:34:25,883 --> 00:34:28,043
It's absolutely absurd.

589
00:34:30,043 --> 00:34:31,283
Oh, my Lord.

590
00:34:31,283 --> 00:34:33,363
HE LAUGHS

591
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:35,483
That's outrageous!

592
00:34:35,483 --> 00:34:38,843
I'm doing 218, 219mph.

593
00:34:42,083 --> 00:34:43,523
Wow!

594
00:34:45,003 --> 00:34:47,723
And it doesn't stop there.

595
00:34:47,723 --> 00:34:51,603
In case all that straight
line fun wears off,

596
00:34:51,603 --> 00:34:55,483
Rimac says they've been to town
on the handling, too.

597
00:34:55,483 --> 00:34:58,563
Each wheel's motor is
independently controlled,

598
00:34:58,563 --> 00:35:02,003
so the way the Nevera drives
can be transformed

599
00:35:02,003 --> 00:35:03,723
at the flick of a switch.

600
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:06,523
A switch that includes...

601
00:35:08,083 --> 00:35:09,243
..drift mode.

602
00:35:12,403 --> 00:35:14,883
TYRES SCREECH

603
00:35:16,043 --> 00:35:17,523
Dear me!

604
00:35:17,523 --> 00:35:21,123
Mate! This is a drift beast
like I've never been in before.

605
00:35:28,403 --> 00:35:31,123
TYRES SCREECH

606
00:35:38,123 --> 00:35:39,683
It's so easy.

607
00:35:39,683 --> 00:35:41,963
It's just wind the lock on,

608
00:35:41,963 --> 00:35:43,243
bit of throttle.

609
00:35:46,563 --> 00:35:47,803
Whoa-ho-ho!

610
00:35:47,803 --> 00:35:49,363
Oh, they're clever.

611
00:35:49,363 --> 00:35:51,163
They're clever. And it's fun.

612
00:35:51,163 --> 00:35:52,883
It's fun and it's silly.

613
00:36:00,043 --> 00:36:01,923
This car slides.

614
00:36:01,923 --> 00:36:04,523
It feels fantastic
when it's moving around.

615
00:36:04,523 --> 00:36:06,043
I know it doesn't have the noise,

616
00:36:06,043 --> 00:36:09,723
but when you've got
this performance,

617
00:36:09,723 --> 00:36:11,523
I'm starting to wonder if you care.

618
00:36:13,723 --> 00:36:18,763
Of course, we have seen this sort
of digital drifting before.

619
00:36:18,763 --> 00:36:22,803
In recent years, it's become pretty
much the standard party mode

620
00:36:22,803 --> 00:36:25,763
for performance cars
all over the market.

621
00:36:27,763 --> 00:36:29,883
But this being Rimac,

622
00:36:29,883 --> 00:36:33,323
in the Nevera there's also an
afterparty.

623
00:36:34,523 --> 00:36:36,323
Four-wheel drive,

624
00:36:36,323 --> 00:36:38,603
no traction control,

625
00:36:38,603 --> 00:36:40,763
all wheels spinning.

626
00:36:40,763 --> 00:36:41,923
Here we go.

627
00:36:43,883 --> 00:36:45,963
TYRES SCREECH

628
00:36:48,883 --> 00:36:50,123
Good God.

629
00:37:01,323 --> 00:37:03,483
What is going on in this car?

630
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:07,163
We just did a tyre in one skid.

631
00:37:08,283 --> 00:37:10,043
That's just ridiculous.

632
00:37:10,043 --> 00:37:14,603
Mr Rimac, you are my kind
of lunatic.

633
00:37:14,603 --> 00:37:16,203
Yes, you are!

634
00:37:21,043 --> 00:37:23,123
I don't quite know what to say
about that.

635
00:37:28,723 --> 00:37:29,803
Wow.

636
00:37:33,963 --> 00:37:36,443
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

637
00:37:42,043 --> 00:37:44,083
Mind blown.

638
00:37:44,083 --> 00:37:47,083
Mind blown.  That is
absolutely bonkers.

639
00:37:47,083 --> 00:37:49,403
It went past that Lambo
like it was standing still.

640
00:37:49,403 --> 00:37:52,723
It's extraordinary. It's not like
anything I've ever driven before.

641
00:37:52,723 --> 00:37:54,163
It's that fast.

642
00:37:54,163 --> 00:37:56,923
The day after I drove it,
I actually felt a bit queasy.

643
00:37:56,923 --> 00:37:59,243
I don't know whether that's the high
voltage cables

644
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:01,083
or whether my kidneys are bruised.

645
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:05,443
I mean, it's crazy.  So you're saying
your innards have been Rimac'd?

646
00:38:05,443 --> 00:38:08,003
Not a nice sounding phrase,
but that's correct.

647
00:38:08,003 --> 00:38:09,283
THEY LAUGH

648
00:38:09,283 --> 00:38:11,683
And these lads are now in
charge of Bugatti?

649
00:38:11,683 --> 00:38:13,363
Yeah, they are. It's very businessy.

650
00:38:13,363 --> 00:38:16,363
They were bought by Porsche, who've
now put them in charge of Bugatti.

651
00:38:16,363 --> 00:38:18,883
I mean, the whole world's been
changed upside down

652
00:38:18,883 --> 00:38:19,963
in a matter of years.

653
00:38:19,963 --> 00:38:21,883
So is that it, electric's won?

654
00:38:21,883 --> 00:38:24,443
Should all petrol supercars
just give up now?

655
00:38:24,443 --> 00:38:25,603
It's not as simple as that.

656
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:27,843
They need to give up on
the acceleration and speed race

657
00:38:27,843 --> 00:38:30,283
because these things are so fast,
there's no catching up.

658
00:38:30,283 --> 00:38:32,203
Petrol needs to trade
on emotion now.

659
00:38:32,203 --> 00:38:34,443
Gear changes, sound, go lightweight,

660
00:38:34,443 --> 00:38:37,603
but don't try and out-accelerate
this monster cos you will lose.

661
00:38:37,603 --> 00:38:39,123
Well, with that in mind,

662
00:38:39,123 --> 00:38:41,563
when are we going to get
it on the track?

663
00:38:41,563 --> 00:38:44,403
Slight problem. It's so fast,
we've got to update the software

664
00:38:44,403 --> 00:38:46,723
on The Stig because he can't deal
with it just yet,

665
00:38:46,723 --> 00:38:48,563
but hopefully next year.

666
00:38:48,563 --> 00:38:50,563
OK, watch this space.

667
00:38:50,563 --> 00:38:52,963
But now it's time to get back
to Thailand,

668
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:57,923
where Fred was properly in a bad
way - coughing, shivering, the lot.

669
00:38:57,923 --> 00:39:00,963
So Chris and I did what any true
mates would do.

670
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,723
Left him to it
and enjoyed the rest of our trip!

671
00:39:03,723 --> 00:39:05,163
CROWD CHEERS

672
00:39:05,163 --> 00:39:06,603
LAUGHING

673
00:39:11,203 --> 00:39:13,763
With Flintoff left behind
in Bangkok,

674
00:39:13,763 --> 00:39:17,003
me and Harris had pointed
our pick-ups north.

675
00:39:22,563 --> 00:39:26,243
Our mission now was to haul a
much-needed cargo

676
00:39:26,243 --> 00:39:30,563
to a remote hill village
near the border with Laos.

677
00:39:30,563 --> 00:39:34,283
Nice to have been given
something useful to do.

678
00:39:34,283 --> 00:39:38,923
Plus, hauling for free meant
we'd had to start doing things

679
00:39:38,923 --> 00:39:40,443
the local way.

680
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:54,803
I've got to be honest, I'm happy
with the extra weight in the back.

681
00:39:54,803 --> 00:39:57,483
It just gives the car a bit
more stability.

682
00:39:57,483 --> 00:40:01,083
And whereas when we first saw
something overloaded coming past us,

683
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:03,603
we sort of whooped with joy,
they're probably going,

684
00:40:03,603 --> 00:40:05,603
"Amateur. We could get another
bale on that."

685
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:09,963
I know, it's bonkers, isn't it?

686
00:40:09,963 --> 00:40:16,083
It was bonkers, particularly
given two important points.

687
00:40:17,403 --> 00:40:19,883
I've got one thing on my mind,
though, Pad -

688
00:40:19,883 --> 00:40:25,323
I've never seen so much fresh grass,
so why are we carrying grass?

689
00:40:26,283 --> 00:40:28,403
I've seen quite a few cows
knocking about,

690
00:40:28,403 --> 00:40:30,723
maybe we're taking them
a bit to feed.

691
00:40:30,723 --> 00:40:33,683
Do cows eat hay or is that horses?

692
00:40:35,923 --> 00:40:37,643
They do eat hay, yes.

693
00:40:39,523 --> 00:40:43,003
I reckon we're going feeding
a load of cows.

694
00:40:43,003 --> 00:40:47,443
Whatever the bales
were actually for, though,

695
00:40:47,443 --> 00:40:51,923
as the miles ticked up,
the second, more pressing issue

696
00:40:51,923 --> 00:40:55,723
was that the scenery was
getting bigger.

697
00:40:55,723 --> 00:40:57,363
You look to your left,

698
00:40:57,363 --> 00:41:01,043
you've just got
a tree-and-foliage-covered mountain

699
00:41:01,043 --> 00:41:03,643
with a vast amount
of weather coming off it.

700
00:41:03,643 --> 00:41:06,563
Look at the moisture coming off
these hills.

701
00:41:06,563 --> 00:41:09,803
Can you say "look at the moisture
coming off these hills" again

702
00:41:09,803 --> 00:41:11,283
but a little bit slower?

703
00:41:15,923 --> 00:41:18,723
This is ominous.
We're climbing up a hill.

704
00:41:21,043 --> 00:41:24,643
Yeah, it's starting to get
tarmac-y now.

705
00:41:34,963 --> 00:41:39,163
I've got a funny feeling
this is more D-Max country.

706
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:42,043
Oh, this is what the D-Max loves.

707
00:41:42,043 --> 00:41:45,163
Ooh-oh.

708
00:41:52,403 --> 00:41:55,643
Oh, this looks like it's too much
for me.

709
00:41:55,643 --> 00:41:57,803
Come on, then, little fella.

710
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:01,003
CAR CLATTERS

711
00:42:01,003 --> 00:42:02,483
It's sounding good, this.

712
00:42:02,483 --> 00:42:03,923
Oh, my Lord.

713
00:42:03,923 --> 00:42:05,323
Oh, God.

714
00:42:06,803 --> 00:42:10,523
The D-Max absolutely loves
this terrain.

715
00:42:10,523 --> 00:42:12,923
Power, power, power.

716
00:42:12,923 --> 00:42:14,683
Power, power, power!

717
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:17,723
Come on, old girl.

718
00:42:19,123 --> 00:42:20,243
Come on, old girl.

719
00:42:20,243 --> 00:42:23,163
This is where the two-wheel drive
has been found out, Chris.

720
00:42:23,163 --> 00:42:26,163
She's struggling now.
This is like live Jenga.

721
00:42:27,883 --> 00:42:30,883
Oh, your load's looking
a little bit wobbly, there, Chris.

722
00:42:32,043 --> 00:42:34,243
Stop! You've lost a bale.

723
00:42:34,243 --> 00:42:36,443
You've lost a bale, son.

724
00:42:36,443 --> 00:42:37,843
Come back.

725
00:42:37,843 --> 00:42:39,923
I can't lose a bale.

726
00:42:39,923 --> 00:42:42,163
Keep coming.  How far back
can I come?

727
00:42:42,163 --> 00:42:44,683
Keep coming. That'll do you.

728
00:42:49,803 --> 00:42:51,083
Shall we just lob it up?

729
00:42:51,083 --> 00:42:52,843
You ready? One, two, three.

730
00:42:57,043 --> 00:42:58,563
Well, it sort of worked.

731
00:43:01,723 --> 00:43:06,963
Back on the move, though, our
oversized and badly lashed cargo

732
00:43:06,963 --> 00:43:11,163
was quickly becoming the least
of Harris's concerns.

733
00:43:12,203 --> 00:43:14,003
I've got an issue -
my air con's gone

734
00:43:14,003 --> 00:43:15,643
and also I've lost the front window,

735
00:43:15,643 --> 00:43:17,763
so I'm just sitting, literally,
in an oven now.

736
00:43:18,843 --> 00:43:20,883
Sitrep on the D-Max.

737
00:43:22,443 --> 00:43:23,923
Everything's fine.

738
00:43:24,963 --> 00:43:28,723
Aircon's blowing a bit extreme,
though. Bit chilly in here.

739
00:43:31,683 --> 00:43:38,923
3 Series with a black vinyl interior
in this heat is a hot place to be.

740
00:43:41,843 --> 00:43:44,163
I can't deal with this.

741
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:46,643
This heat is just absurd.

742
00:43:49,683 --> 00:43:55,083
And so my slow coupe colleague set
about redesigning the ventilation

743
00:43:55,083 --> 00:43:56,243
on his Beemer.

744
00:43:57,443 --> 00:43:59,003
What are you doing?

745
00:44:03,283 --> 00:44:05,523
I've broken the door
but not the window.

746
00:44:08,883 --> 00:44:10,283
What are you doing?

747
00:44:10,283 --> 00:44:13,523
Just trying to deal with my
ventilation issues at the moment.

748
00:44:13,523 --> 00:44:16,043
I'm just going to have a minute
to contemplate it

749
00:44:16,043 --> 00:44:17,203
if you don't mind, Pad.

750
00:44:17,203 --> 00:44:20,923
So, the place to contemplate it
is on a steep gradient

751
00:44:20,923 --> 00:44:22,323
on a gravel track?

752
00:44:23,483 --> 00:44:25,323
Oh, my God. What are you doing?

753
00:44:25,323 --> 00:44:27,963
I've got to get rid of that glass.
I can't breathe.

754
00:44:27,963 --> 00:44:29,163
What?

755
00:44:30,683 --> 00:44:32,683
Great work.

756
00:44:32,683 --> 00:44:34,643
Ha-ha, ha!

757
00:44:35,763 --> 00:44:39,763
I feel like this is a job
for a man from Bolton.

758
00:44:39,763 --> 00:44:41,683
Watch yourself, son.

759
00:44:45,443 --> 00:44:47,443
Thank you, Pad.  There you go.

760
00:44:49,483 --> 00:44:51,323
Lovely.

761
00:44:51,323 --> 00:44:54,123
Would you like me to give you
a little nudge?

762
00:44:54,123 --> 00:44:56,083
This is going to hurt, isn't it?

763
00:44:57,563 --> 00:44:59,123
ENGINE REVS

764
00:44:59,123 --> 00:45:00,603
Oh.

765
00:45:02,243 --> 00:45:04,163
There she goes. There she goes.

766
00:45:06,243 --> 00:45:09,043
Go on. Go on, the D-Max!

767
00:45:09,043 --> 00:45:12,803
That low range is
doing the business!

768
00:45:12,803 --> 00:45:14,883
Right up your chuff.

769
00:45:20,643 --> 00:45:22,723
One of the biggest problems
with the D-Max, Chris,

770
00:45:22,723 --> 00:45:26,763
when you're driving it
is your fingers get cold.

771
00:45:26,763 --> 00:45:29,523
It's so... It's like driving
a fridge, this thing.

772
00:45:31,003 --> 00:45:33,003
This isn't aimed at you,
dear viewer,

773
00:45:33,003 --> 00:45:35,443
this is aimed at Paddy McGuinness.

774
00:45:37,283 --> 00:45:38,963
Rude.

775
00:45:38,963 --> 00:45:42,563
After all, the D-Max had got us both
up to the top of the hill

776
00:45:42,563 --> 00:45:47,043
and our destination was now
just around the corner.

777
00:45:47,043 --> 00:45:49,803
Where are we going now?
Oh, look at this.

778
00:45:49,803 --> 00:45:51,643
Look at this!

779
00:45:51,643 --> 00:45:55,363
This has got to be the place.
That's a surprise, isn't it?

780
00:45:57,203 --> 00:45:59,443
Look at this, McGuinness,
a beautiful little village.

781
00:45:59,443 --> 00:46:01,123
Hang on.

782
00:46:01,123 --> 00:46:03,163
You're taking the bunting.

783
00:46:05,723 --> 00:46:07,243
Chris.

784
00:46:07,243 --> 00:46:09,323
You've got a man on the side
of your car, Chris.

785
00:46:09,323 --> 00:46:12,723
Chris, you've got a man
on the side of your car.  Have I?

786
00:46:12,723 --> 00:46:16,563
LAUGHING: He just drove off.
He's on the side of your car.

787
00:46:16,563 --> 00:46:18,963
Is he still holding on to it?
I can't see anything.

788
00:46:23,683 --> 00:46:26,883
Slightly embarrassing arrival
notwithstanding,

789
00:46:26,883 --> 00:46:29,923
we had two flatbeds full of bales,

790
00:46:29,923 --> 00:46:33,163
which, as the villagers set
about unloading...

791
00:46:33,163 --> 00:46:34,243
Hello.

792
00:46:34,243 --> 00:46:39,123
..we would soon discover were
definitely not for feeding the cows.

793
00:46:40,523 --> 00:46:41,763
Now...

794
00:46:42,763 --> 00:46:46,283
..it doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to
work out - there's the hay bales...

795
00:46:46,283 --> 00:46:47,443
Yeah.

796
00:46:47,443 --> 00:46:49,323
..that looks like a finish line.

797
00:46:49,323 --> 00:46:50,643
So it's a racetrack.

798
00:46:51,763 --> 00:46:53,443
Yep.

799
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:57,043
And what they race around here
are these.

800
00:47:00,003 --> 00:47:02,123
Known as Formula Hmong,

801
00:47:02,123 --> 00:47:06,363
this traditional Thai downhill event
is about as grassroots

802
00:47:06,363 --> 00:47:07,883
as motorsport gets.

803
00:47:09,523 --> 00:47:11,763
The braking is rudimentary,

804
00:47:11,763 --> 00:47:13,963
the steering is done by foot,

805
00:47:13,963 --> 00:47:15,763
the only fuel is gravity,

806
00:47:15,763 --> 00:47:20,363
and the machines themselves are,
let's say, sustainably sourced.

807
00:47:22,643 --> 00:47:25,323
And as a thank you
for safely delivering

808
00:47:25,323 --> 00:47:27,483
their plant-based barriers,

809
00:47:27,483 --> 00:47:31,483
they were kind enough
to let us have a go.

810
00:47:31,483 --> 00:47:33,483
You know what?
I love his safety gear.

811
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:36,323
White pumps, trackie pants.
He's got some elbow protection on.

812
00:47:36,323 --> 00:47:39,243
That lad there's got a spoiler
so he can alter his downforce.

813
00:47:39,243 --> 00:47:41,803
And he's got a pair of wellies on.
He's got welly boots on.

814
00:47:41,803 --> 00:47:44,763
Gentlemen, start your...legs.

815
00:47:44,763 --> 00:47:45,803
OK...

816
00:47:47,043 --> 00:47:49,003
Oh, no, they're gone. They're gone.

817
00:47:53,243 --> 00:47:55,723
Not a lot of suspension, is there?
We'd be off there.

818
00:47:55,723 --> 00:47:57,643
Yeah, we're not going as fast
as that.

819
00:48:03,843 --> 00:48:05,323
Oh, he's off!

820
00:48:06,843 --> 00:48:08,243
APPLAUSE

821
00:48:08,243 --> 00:48:09,923
Dear me.

822
00:48:09,923 --> 00:48:13,163
Dear me!

823
00:48:13,163 --> 00:48:15,843
And then it was our turn.

824
00:48:17,763 --> 00:48:20,603
You're welcome to this win,
by the way, McGuinness.  Er...

825
00:48:20,603 --> 00:48:23,323
The feeling is reciprocated.

826
00:48:24,603 --> 00:48:26,163
Formula Hmong.

827
00:48:27,443 --> 00:48:30,163
Good luck, brother.  Good luck.

828
00:48:30,163 --> 00:48:33,003
Come on, then, you horrible
wooden bastard.

829
00:48:33,003 --> 00:48:34,763
PADDY LAUGHS

830
00:48:37,523 --> 00:48:39,123
Ready?  Yeah.  OK.

831
00:48:44,523 --> 00:48:47,003
I've got him! I've got him
straight away!

832
00:48:47,003 --> 00:48:49,003
That's a jump start for Guinness.

833
00:48:49,003 --> 00:48:51,443
Oh, where's the bloody brakes?

834
00:48:51,443 --> 00:48:55,043
He's getting away from me.
How's he so quick?

835
00:48:55,043 --> 00:48:56,363
I can't steer it.

836
00:48:57,643 --> 00:49:00,203
Whoa! My word!

837
00:49:01,443 --> 00:49:03,163
Whoa!

838
00:49:03,163 --> 00:49:04,603
Oh, my God.

839
00:49:08,483 --> 00:49:11,043
I'm catching him.
I'm definitely catching him.

840
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:14,843
Where's Harris? Is
he on my shoulder? Where is he?

841
00:49:14,843 --> 00:49:16,403
I can't see him.

842
00:49:16,403 --> 00:49:18,843
I've got absolutely no control
over this thing.

843
00:49:19,883 --> 00:49:21,443
Oh, no.

844
00:49:28,683 --> 00:49:30,523
Oh, whoa.

845
00:49:30,523 --> 00:49:33,483
APPLAUSE

846
00:49:33,483 --> 00:49:34,963
Where is he?

847
00:49:36,603 --> 00:49:38,003
Oh...

848
00:49:47,843 --> 00:49:49,243
That was a shunt.

849
00:49:50,683 --> 00:49:52,243
Oh...  You all right?

850
00:49:53,923 --> 00:49:55,883
My hand really hurts.

851
00:49:55,883 --> 00:49:58,723
That's going to smart
in the morning, that is.

852
00:49:58,723 --> 00:50:03,523
So, with Harris's career in
Formula Hmong ending as quickly

853
00:50:03,523 --> 00:50:08,403
as it started, it turned out
the winner would now have the honour

854
00:50:08,403 --> 00:50:11,363
of running the course again.

855
00:50:11,363 --> 00:50:15,083
This time,
against one of the local pros.

856
00:50:16,123 --> 00:50:19,123
Nice to meet you.
I saw you oiling your wheels up.

857
00:50:19,123 --> 00:50:20,483
I'm not that big of a threat.

858
00:50:20,483 --> 00:50:22,603
You don't need that. Trust me.

859
00:50:26,203 --> 00:50:27,243
Here we go.

860
00:50:27,243 --> 00:50:28,563
Ooh-hoo.

861
00:50:28,563 --> 00:50:30,243
OFFICIAL READIES THEM

862
00:50:30,243 --> 00:50:31,523
OK?  OK.

863
00:50:31,523 --> 00:50:34,963
OFFICIAL COUNTS THEM DOWN

864
00:50:34,963 --> 00:50:36,643
We're off!

865
00:50:39,643 --> 00:50:41,123
I'm taking him!

866
00:50:41,123 --> 00:50:42,643
I've taken him! I've got it!

867
00:50:42,643 --> 00:50:44,123
I've got it!

868
00:50:45,283 --> 00:50:47,523
Oh, no, no, no. He's here.
He's here.

869
00:50:47,523 --> 00:50:49,403
Aah! He's gone past me!

870
00:50:50,403 --> 00:50:52,523
He is flying. I can't catch him!

871
00:50:54,083 --> 00:50:55,643
Come on, Pad.

872
00:50:57,283 --> 00:50:59,723
Come on. Come on, McGuinness.
Come on!

873
00:51:01,603 --> 00:51:03,003
I can hear something.

874
00:51:03,003 --> 00:51:04,403
I can see the line.
I can see a line.

875
00:51:04,403 --> 00:51:06,123
I'm going for it!
I'm going for it!

876
00:51:06,123 --> 00:51:08,403
I can hear him now.
I can hear him now.

877
00:51:08,403 --> 00:51:09,803
I'm going for it!
Nearly there!

878
00:51:09,803 --> 00:51:12,523
I've got him! I've got him!
Oh, no!

879
00:51:16,843 --> 00:51:18,243
Jesus!

880
00:51:19,363 --> 00:51:21,243
Mate, are you all right?

881
00:51:21,243 --> 00:51:22,683
Oh, my God!

882
00:51:22,683 --> 00:51:24,723
What are you doing?!
I nearly had him.

883
00:51:24,723 --> 00:51:26,963
Come on!
I nearly had him.

884
00:51:26,963 --> 00:51:28,643
Get over the line.

885
00:51:28,643 --> 00:51:30,283
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

886
00:51:34,043 --> 00:51:35,323
Fantastic.

887
00:51:36,803 --> 00:51:40,963
Chalking up Formula Hmong, then, as
one of our more painful

888
00:51:40,963 --> 00:51:42,323
motorsport failures...

889
00:51:42,323 --> 00:51:44,323
Aah!  Oh, sorry. PADDY LAUGHS

890
00:51:44,323 --> 00:51:46,483
..we left the winner with
a parting gift of

891
00:51:46,483 --> 00:51:48,123
lightly soiled body armour...

892
00:51:48,123 --> 00:51:49,243
Thank you. Thank you.

893
00:51:49,243 --> 00:51:50,683
CHEERING

894
00:51:50,683 --> 00:51:54,083
..and then it was time to return
to our pick-ups.

895
00:51:55,443 --> 00:51:59,963
Because, having now proven their
Thai readiness to the local village,

896
00:51:59,963 --> 00:52:03,243
while we've been busy getting
battered and bruised,

897
00:52:03,243 --> 00:52:07,043
they'd been tasked with
one last job.

898
00:52:09,163 --> 00:52:14,043
That job would take us to the next
hilltop where a new temple

899
00:52:14,043 --> 00:52:15,723
was under construction.

900
00:52:17,363 --> 00:52:23,723
Its exterior is covered in thousands
upon thousands of tiles.

901
00:52:25,403 --> 00:52:30,883
And so, to help complete it,
that was the cargo we'd bring.

902
00:52:31,963 --> 00:52:39,083
Loaded up with a muddy road ahead,
setting out to be useful once more.

903
00:52:51,523 --> 00:52:52,603
The pick-up.

904
00:52:52,603 --> 00:52:55,443
I know we've tried to joke around
them, but these things are the

905
00:52:55,443 --> 00:52:57,123
workforce of humanity, aren't they?

906
00:52:57,123 --> 00:52:58,963
There's something
about an honest pick-up.

907
00:52:58,963 --> 00:53:02,083
When you see one on the road,
you know, ultimately, it's helping

908
00:53:02,083 --> 00:53:05,083
someone somewhere,
or giving someone something.

909
00:53:05,083 --> 00:53:09,043
It just makes you feel good
about yourself.

910
00:53:09,043 --> 00:53:13,323
And I'm telling you now, I know
we're in the jungles of Thailand,

911
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:18,363
but no matter where I'd be dropped
in the world, I'd pick the D-Max.

912
00:53:20,083 --> 00:53:21,843
It has served you well.

913
00:53:21,843 --> 00:53:23,923
And it's actually served me
pretty well as well.

914
00:53:25,923 --> 00:53:30,203
By the word, I can see the temple
'pon the hill.

915
00:53:31,523 --> 00:53:33,443
Come on. We're nearly there.

916
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:36,763
So are we awarding that victory
to the D-Max,

917
00:53:36,763 --> 00:53:39,803
given that I turned up in a saloon
car and hacked the back off it

918
00:53:39,803 --> 00:53:42,763
and Flintoff is still in isolation?

919
00:53:42,763 --> 00:53:44,283
I think so.

920
00:53:53,443 --> 00:53:54,563
My word.

921
00:53:56,003 --> 00:53:57,963
Wow!

922
00:53:57,963 --> 00:54:00,323
This is mega, Chris.

923
00:54:01,643 --> 00:54:04,763
I'm going to have a soppy moment
and say this is quite special.

924
00:54:06,323 --> 00:54:07,403
Wow.

925
00:54:08,443 --> 00:54:10,203
That is something else.

926
00:54:13,763 --> 00:54:17,483
Look at that.
They climb up there and tile that?

927
00:54:17,483 --> 00:54:19,003
It's amazing.

928
00:54:19,003 --> 00:54:23,003
Cor. So each of those goes...
On that roof.

929
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:29,203
Right, which is your hood hand?
Left.

930
00:54:29,203 --> 00:54:31,283
You got it?  Yeah.
You sure?  Yeah, let's go.

931
00:54:31,283 --> 00:54:33,003
Right, up we go.

932
00:54:42,163 --> 00:54:43,563
Wow!

933
00:54:44,963 --> 00:54:47,123
What a place.

934
00:54:47,123 --> 00:54:48,403
Amazing.

935
00:54:49,563 --> 00:54:51,163
These are stunning.

936
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:52,203
Wow.

937
00:54:53,683 --> 00:54:57,203
That is a big, big statue.

938
00:54:57,203 --> 00:54:59,883
Look at the size of that guy there.
I know.

939
00:55:02,003 --> 00:55:03,763
Look at the size of him!

940
00:55:05,643 --> 00:55:09,003
You can't take it all in.
You look up - it's so much.

941
00:55:09,003 --> 00:55:10,243
It is massive.

942
00:55:12,363 --> 00:55:14,323
He's waiting. It looks like
he's waiting for us.

943
00:55:14,323 --> 00:55:15,963
Pop them down there.

944
00:55:15,963 --> 00:55:17,483
Pop them down.

945
00:55:18,443 --> 00:55:20,163
Sawadee kraap.

946
00:55:24,843 --> 00:55:29,323
Apparently we need
another 600,000 of them.

947
00:55:29,323 --> 00:55:31,363
600,000?  600,000.

948
00:55:31,363 --> 00:55:34,683
Where's Flintoff when you need him?

949
00:55:34,683 --> 00:55:36,643
Flintoff!

950
00:55:36,643 --> 00:55:38,403
Back down to the pick-up.

951
00:55:41,203 --> 00:55:43,523
Thank you, Thailand.

952
00:55:43,523 --> 00:55:44,963
Tile-land.

953
00:55:47,643 --> 00:55:50,203
Kicking myself for not
coming up with that one.

954
00:55:52,083 --> 00:55:53,963
How's your body.  Broken.

955
00:55:53,963 --> 00:55:56,003
Good. Good, good, good.

956
00:56:00,363 --> 00:56:03,403
STUDIO AUDIENCE CHEERS AND APPLAUDS

957
00:56:06,043 --> 00:56:08,723
Beautiful.  Beautiful country.

958
00:56:08,723 --> 00:56:13,243
Beautiful.  Amazing.
Amazing. Amazing.

959
00:56:13,243 --> 00:56:17,603
What a place that temple
was and what a pleasure to help out.

960
00:56:17,603 --> 00:56:19,443
And Fred, I'm gutted
you weren't there, pal,

961
00:56:19,443 --> 00:56:22,043
because he'd have been handy
carrying them tiles up them steps,

962
00:56:22,043 --> 00:56:23,803
wouldn't he?
Oh, cheers, thanks. Yeah.

963
00:56:23,803 --> 00:56:25,323
Thanks, Pad, but I am upset, too.

964
00:56:25,323 --> 00:56:28,803
Firstly because my Hilux would have
smashed your two up the hill.  Oh.

965
00:56:28,803 --> 00:56:30,923
Oh, come on, the Hilux.
Yeah?

966
00:56:30,923 --> 00:56:33,363
And secondly, Formula Hmong.
Oof.

967
00:56:33,363 --> 00:56:35,123
That's my type of motorsport.

968
00:56:35,123 --> 00:56:37,003
Just falling.  Yeah!

969
00:56:37,003 --> 00:56:39,363
Gravity is your specialist subject,
to be fair.

970
00:56:39,363 --> 00:56:41,523
Exactly, I'd have wiped the floor
with you two.  Yeah.

971
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:45,603
We did a pretty good job of that
ourselves, actually, Fred.  Yeah,
we certainly did. We certainly did.

972
00:56:45,603 --> 00:56:47,443
Great trip, though,
and an amazing country.

973
00:56:47,443 --> 00:56:49,403
Thailand, thanks for having us.

974
00:56:49,403 --> 00:56:52,523
Well, that's it for tonight,
but we're back next week as we head

975
00:56:52,523 --> 00:56:55,123
to Paris in some tiny cars,

976
00:56:55,123 --> 00:56:58,003
and Germany in some
very fast supercars.

977
00:56:58,003 --> 00:57:00,203
See you then. Thanks for watching.
Goodnight.
