CLARKSON: Tonight,
Richard tests a van...

3
00:00:20,967 --> 00:00:23,200
I drive an old
brown Porsche...

4
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:26,500
And James uses a telephone.

5
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,500
Hello, everybody!
Hello and welcome!

6
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:42,067
Thank you so much.
Thank you, everybody,
thank you. Now.

7
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:45,633
Now.

8
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:50,433
Ambulance response times
have been in the news
just recently.

9
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:55,500
It seems that many
ambulances aren't getting
to critically ill patients

10
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:59,900
as fast as they should be
and nobody seems to know why.

11
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:02,267
Except us.

12
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,867
You see,
the National Health Service
believes that this

13
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,067
is a fast response vehicle.

14
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:12,900
But it isn't even
on nodding terms
with the concept of fast.

15
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:16,567
It started out in life
as a van with
a diesel engine,

16
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,567
and then they added
more weight.

17
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,567
And that gave us an idea.

00:01:27,367 --> 00:01:28,600
(SIREN WAILING)

19
00:01:28,633 --> 00:01:31,067
CLARKSON: Here's
a traditional ambulance.

20
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:33,667
It's big and it's bulky

21
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,067
and it's stuck
in rush-hour traffic.

22
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,067
Plus, it's being driven
by a chap

23
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:40,967
who knows
how to drain a lung,

24
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,200
but he doesn't know
how to trail-break

25
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:46,733
or execute
a racing gear change.

26
00:01:46,767 --> 00:01:49,867
Our ambulance, however,
is very different.

27
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,833
Yes, it's The Stig

28
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:56,800
in an emergency version
of Top Gear's P45,

29
00:01:56,833 --> 00:02:00,133
the smallest road-legal car
ever made.

30
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,067
That means it can fit through
the tiniest gaps.

31
00:02:06,667 --> 00:02:10,367
And make its own lane
in the jams.

32
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,933
And when it gets to the scene
of an emergency,

33
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:15,533
it can drive
right up to the building

34
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:18,400
and then go inside.

35
00:02:18,433 --> 00:02:23,600
All of this saves time
and saving time saves lives.

36
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,700
Of course, you're
probably wondering

37
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:30,167
how on earth the patient can
now be transported to hospital

38
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,333
in an ambulance
as small as this.

39
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:35,667
Well, that is where our genius
really comes into play.

40
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,067
Because, well, here comes
The Stig now with a patient

41
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:41,367
who has been literally
bored into a coma

42
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,467
by one of the meetings
they have in here.

43
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,433
Yes, now, as you can see,
he simply has to clip

44
00:02:45,467 --> 00:02:47,667
the stretcher onto
the back of the P45

45
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,900
-and he's ready to go.
-HAMMOND: Yeah.

46
00:02:49,933 --> 00:02:52,600
CLARKSON: Sometimes I think
our genius is tangible.

47
00:02:52,633 --> 00:02:54,200
It's like it has a mass.

48
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:55,733
Yeah, it's like
another presence.

49
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:57,500
-It's still there
when we've gone.
-CLARKSON: Yeah.

50
00:02:57,533 --> 00:03:00,067
I mean, we've sold many things
over the years

51
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,700
but I think that is our
finest hour. It really is.

52
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:04,967
HAMMOND: I think it's
up there with the best
work we've ever done.

53
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:07,833
CLARKSON: That is a work of...
HAMMOND: Ooh, jeez!

54
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,567
HAMMOND: Oh.
CLARKSON: Oh.

55
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,067
I think we need
to call for an ambulance.

56
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:16,267
-HAMMOND: That's a good idea.
-Okay, I'll do it.

57
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,800
Do you know
what the number is?

58
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,667
Nine...

59

"You idiots..." Oh.

62
00:03:29,267 --> 00:03:30,733
-Well, they've got
a point this time.
-Yeah.

63
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:32,433
"You've killed a man."

64
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:33,900
HAMMOND: Well, I'm sorry.
He wasn't going to
make it anyway.

65
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:35,067
No, I don't think he was.

66
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,600
-He looked very peaky.
-He did.

67
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,100
"It's all very well building
a faster ambulance

68
00:03:39,133 --> 00:03:42,633

if you have to tow
the patient to hospital.

69
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:43,967

to the drawing board

"and for once do it properly."

-Right.
-Mmm-hmm. Okay.

72
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:52,900
So we've got to build
something that's faster
than a normal ambulance.

73
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,800
MAY: Yeah, but it's gotta have
room for the patient.

74
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:56,467
-Inside it.
-Inside it, yes.

75
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,167
-That's where
we went wrong, there.
-Yeah. Yeah.

76
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,700
HAMMOND: Naturally,
we couldn't agree

77
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:06,300
on what vehicle we should use
as a start point.

78
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:08,967
So, each of us
went our own way.

00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:18,067
Here is what I have chosen.

81
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,833
Yeah, it is a van,
but it is a Chevy G20.

82
00:04:23,867 --> 00:04:28,500
Under there, 5.7-litre,
small-block Chevy V8.

83
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:31,100
What I've got
is a V8 ambulance,
but there's more.

84
00:04:31,133 --> 00:04:35,333
That thing, £150,000,
this, about £5,000.

85
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:37,667
I'm saving the NHS
a lot of money

86
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,367
that they can spend
better on bandages

87
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,100

that you wee in.

93
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,067
Yes, I know.

94
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,767
It's not very
ambulance-y, is it?

95
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,267
What's wrong with it?

96
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,433
This was actually designed
as an ambulance by Porsche.

97
00:05:04,467 --> 00:05:06,100
-Was it?
-It was.

98
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:07,867
Well, in what way
is it an ambulance?
Make that work for me.

99
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,067
Right, okay, fine.

-Full James May spec. Brown.
-Yes.

101
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,200
-Brown interior, brown carpet,
brown dashboard.
-Oh, I love that.

102
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:16,967
So that if there's a trouser
accident with the patient,

103
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,867
you don't see it.

104
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,567
And the whole point is,
we were told to get
a fast ambulance, were we not?

105
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,500
It's a 944 Turbo.

-Oh, yeah!
-Top speed?

It's so big that they
won't even tell it.

110

-They didn't know
what the top speed is.
-Is it? Is it?

111
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,267
-They can't if there
is no top speed.
-Is it? Is it?

112
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,600
Yeah, look at that.

113
00:05:37,633 --> 00:05:39,933
-Oh.
-Yeah, I know.
It's brilliant, innit?

HAMMOND: Electric seats.

115
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,633
Why is every single car
you ever buy for

something that happens.

No, I'm sorry, Hammond.
Mine is better than yours.

its enormity, I made
Hammond climb into it.

121
00:05:58,867 --> 00:06:00,767
-Oh, brilliant!
-Tell me I've done this wrong.

122
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,700
-Yeah.
-Tell me I've done this wrong.

123
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:05,167
-Erm, one thing?
-What?

124
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,067
It is quite incredibly
hot in here.

125
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:09,067
-Is it?
-I'm in a greenhouse.

126
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:11,167
I'm quite quickly
beginning to cook.

127
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,200

simmered to death...

128
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:14,233
Oh, look.

-Erm...
-Oh, sorry.

-MAY: Gentlemen.
-Oh, God. (WHEEZING)

Behold the
Ford Scorpio Cardinal.

133
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,133
So what's really interesting
about this car

134
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,833
is what's going on under here.

135
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:39,067
This has a 2.9-litre,
quad-cam, 24-valve, V6

136
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:43,267
developed by Cosworth
and giving 207 horsepower.

137
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,567
-And it has traction control.
-Yes, all...

138
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,600
And it has a sport button.

139
00:06:48,633 --> 00:06:52,067
-All very interesting, James.
Very good indeed.
-Mmm-hmm.

140
00:06:52,067 --> 00:06:53,767
But there's a bit of
an elephant in the room.

141
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,967
Yes, I knew you were
going to say that.

142
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:56,833
It's not Ford's
finest styling, I know,

143
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:59,400
but that hardly matters
if you've just fallen
off a ladder, does it?

144
00:06:59,433 --> 00:07:01,067
That's not the elephant
we're talking about.

145
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:03,133
The elephant's
a little further back.

146
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,333
-It's a hearse!
-It is a hearse, James.

147
00:07:05,367 --> 00:07:07,467
HAMMOND: It's what you put
dead people in.

148
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,667
Well, look at it this way.

149
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,367
If you lose the patient,
which does happen,

150
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,067
you've still got a job.

151
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,867
But, look at the plus sides.
It's very fast.
It's very smooth.

152
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,900
-Is it?
-Yes. It is.
It's very refined.

153
00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:19,633
It's the right shape for
patients already.

154
00:07:19,667 --> 00:07:23,400
This is the type of car that
has actually been misused
for years.

155
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:26,333
Tell you what it would make,
brilliant camper van.
Look at it.

156
00:07:26,367 --> 00:07:28,267
Yeah. Yeah.
Good ice cream van as well.

157
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,767
Or a burger van.
Anything like that.
Anything van-like.

158
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,700
Yes, but not an ambulance.

159
00:07:32,733 --> 00:07:35,900
CLARKSON: My protests were
then halted by the arrival
of a challenge.

160
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:38,067
-Ah.
-Go on, then.

with your ambulances

"Many points will be awarded
to the winner."

00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,867

-Well, I'm the winner.

166
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,933
Well, no, you're
parked next to a...

167
00:07:50,967 --> 00:07:53,800
That's a Chevy engine...
That's a Corvette engine
in there, basically,

168
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:55,067
as I have said.

169
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,467
-Shall just do it and see?
-CLARKSON: Yes.

170
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,400
-HAMMOND: Let's get on.
-That's the, sort of, point.

171
00:07:58,433 --> 00:08:02,133
MAY: Moments later, we took
our places on the start line.

172
00:08:02,933 --> 00:08:06,667
Sport, traction control off.

173
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,167
Remain dignified, drive,
I'm ready.

174
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:13,100
Prepare to be surprised.

175
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,933
When this car was new,
it produced 217 horsepower

176
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:22,633
but today, I'm not so sure,
because when I opened
the turbo yesterday,

177
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:24,500
I found this in it.

178
00:08:24,533 --> 00:08:31,367
Bits of what could be gravel
or broken ceramic,
I don't know.

179
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,800
I just know it has no place
in a piece of hi-tech
equipment.

180
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,767
That's almost gone.
I'll just leave it open.

(ENGINES REVVING)

182
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Weirdest ambulance race
in history is about to begin.

183
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:50,433

(SIREN WAILING)

185
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:58,200
Oh! I'm going to win!
I'm getting ahead.
My mirror's dropping out.

186
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,500
Eat my dust, Chevrolet.

187
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:02,533
Oh, my God. No!

188
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,833
The hearse is mighty!

189
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,233
Look at it go! 100!

190
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:17,867
-But it seems, yes...
-Oh, no!

191
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,267
...the Porsche is mightier
than the hearse.

192
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:29,067
And across the line
at 120 miles an hour.

193
00:09:32,067 --> 00:09:34,567
The A-Team had one of these.

194
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,100
Hammond, my commiserations
on you unfortunate loss.

195
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,200
Thank you.

196
00:09:41,067 --> 00:09:42,967
HAMMOND: The fact is, though,

197
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:46,567
that all our vehicles
were faster that
the National Health Service.

198
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,433
And having proved that,

199
00:09:48,467 --> 00:09:52,567
we were told to go off
and make them a bit
more ambulance-y.

200
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,600
Thank you very much.

201
00:09:57,633 --> 00:09:58,967
CLARKSON:
Thank you very much.

202
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,433
Now, we're going
to pick that up...

203
00:10:04,467 --> 00:10:08,067
We'll pick that up later on,
but just before we move on

204
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,433
and do the news,
can I just say,

205
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:12,700
if you're standing in a field
with a severed arm,

206
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:16,033
you don't want the NHS
to arrive in a diesel van,

207
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:17,600
you don't want someone
coming in a hearse...

208
00:10:17,633 --> 00:10:19,267
It's a Cosworth hearse.

209
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,633
I don't care
if it's a Bugatti hearse.

210
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:23,333
It's still a hearse.

211
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:25,733
And what it says
to the patient is,
"You're not gonna make it."

212
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:27,733
-It does, James, it does.
-Yeah.

213
00:10:27,767 --> 00:10:29,933
But the point I'm trying
to make is this, okay.

214
00:10:29,967 --> 00:10:32,633
Not only are you
bothered about
what car they come in,

215
00:10:32,667 --> 00:10:34,200
but also the driver.

216
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:36,733
You don't want to be rescued
by Josh out of Casualty,

217
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:38,400
you want Lewis Hamilton.

218
00:10:38,433 --> 00:10:40,933
-Now that is
a good point, actually.
-CLARKSON: Yeah, it is.

219
00:10:40,967 --> 00:10:43,100
It is because
if you think about it,

220
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:45,000
racing drivers
are like actors.

221
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:48,033
At any given moment,
97% of them are out of work.

222
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:50,033
So why doesn't the NHS
take them on?

223
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,667
They could be doing
something useful.

224
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,400
And what's Nigel Mansell
doing these days?
'Cause he'd be...

225
00:10:54,433 --> 00:10:56,767
-(LAUGHTER)
-No, he would be a brilliant
ambulance driver, wouldn't he.

226
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,000
-CLARKSON: He would?
-With his comforting
Brummie accent

227
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,067
and his reassuring moustache.

228
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:02,533
-(LAUGHTER)
-In the front
of the ambulance.

229
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:03,933
I'd love to know he was there.

230
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:06,333
Anyway, we must now
do the news, and...
Oh, yes.

231
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,700
We've had a number
of complaints
about last week's show.

232
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:13,067
People said it was cruel
to blow up a cow.

233
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,800
Erm, but I want to make it
absolutely plain, right now,

234
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:20,900
no cow was hurt
in the making of that film.

235
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:23,467
-Its death was instantaneous.
-HAMMOND: Yeah.

236
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,633
-Wouldn't have felt it...
-Immediate.
It wouldn't have known.

237
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:28,900
-Right. Next?
-Yes, I have news,
very exciting news.

238
00:11:28,933 --> 00:11:30,833
It is a new Ferrari.

239
00:11:30,867 --> 00:11:32,700
There is a picture of it here.

240
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,900
-That...
-CLARKSON: Holy moly.

241
00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:35,467
HAMMOND: Wow.
MAY: Yes, indeed.

242
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,867
That is the 488 GTB.

243
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:42,833
It has a 3.9-litre
turbocharged V8,
661 horsepower,

244
00:11:42,867 --> 00:11:45,067
nought to 60 in three seconds.

245
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,800
And, correct me if I'm wrong,
this is the replacement,
isn't it, for the 458.

246
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,233
Yes, it is.

247
00:11:50,267 --> 00:11:52,067
I'm just thinking,
if you had a 458,

248
00:11:52,067 --> 00:11:54,267
you'd be feeling
suicidal now, wouldn't you.

249
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,267
Yeah, you would, yeah.

250
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,733
-That's prettier...
-Yep.

251
00:11:56,767 --> 00:11:58,133
Faster...

252
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:00,333
It's turbocharged so it does
25 miles to the gallon,

253
00:12:00,367 --> 00:12:04,200
-50% more downforce
than the 458...
-HAMMOND: Yeah. Yeah.

254
00:12:04,233 --> 00:12:05,100
Yeah, yeah.

255
00:12:05,133 --> 00:12:07,067
-James.
-Yes, Richard.

256
00:12:07,067 --> 00:12:08,900
-Haven't you got a 458?
-CLARKSON: Oh.

257
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:11,767
-Completely forgot.
-Yes, I have.

258
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,467
It's... It's worthless now.

259
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,767
Really, truly worthless
now that they've done that.

260
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,767
You might want to just
give it away to a member of
the audience here. I mean...

261
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,133
AUDIENCE: (IN UNISON) James.

262
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:23,067
HAMMOND: What?
It's worthless.

263
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:25,100
I think we should maybe
put it... But let's open it
to all the viewers.

264
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:27,733
-HAMMOND: Yeah.
-If you'd like
James's Ferrari,

265
00:12:27,767 --> 00:12:29,967
write to us at
James May,

266
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:32,533
I'll Take That Ferrari
Off Your Hands If I Must,

267
00:12:33,167 --> 00:12:36,633
BBC, London, wherever we are.

268
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:39,700
You know, people are actually
going to write in now.

269
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:40,867
HAMMOND: Yes, definitely.

270
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,567
And we're actually going
to give it away.

271
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,733
Yeah, we are.

272
00:12:43,767 --> 00:12:45,100
We're committed now,
we said it on air.

273
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:46,567
That is a thing of
extraordinary beauty,

274
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,700
but I have to say this,
McLaren quick to respond.

275
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:51,367
They also have
announced a new car.

276
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,833
Can't remember
what it's called.
It doesn't matter.

277
00:12:52,867 --> 00:12:54,567
They sent us a picture of it.
Here it is.

278
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,700
-(ALL LAUGHING)
-CLARKSON:
I'm not actually joking.

279
00:12:57,733 --> 00:13:00,667
They genuinely
sent that out, going,
"We've got a new car."

280
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,500
-Not...
-It's not actually
a car, is it.

281
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:04,067
CLARKSON: Not really, no.
HAMMOND: It's not finished.

282
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,067
I think I prefer the Ferrari.

283
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,800
Now. I want to talk
about immigration.

284
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,733
Erm, and...

285
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:15,400
As I said that, the entire
BBC management team
sat bolt upright, didn't they.

286
00:13:15,433 --> 00:13:18,767
Sat up and went, "Oh, no,
where's he going with this."

287
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,800
Well, relax, ladies.

288
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,533
Don't choke on your tofu.

289
00:13:25,933 --> 00:13:28,100
All I want to say is,
if you are an immigrant,

290
00:13:28,133 --> 00:13:30,267
you've just
arrived in Britain,
welcome.

291
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,900
Make yourselves at home,
I hope you're very
happy here.

292
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:34,333
Yeah, absolutely,
we mean this.

293
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:36,167
Thank you for coming here.
Thank you for working hard.

294
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,367
Thank you for paying taxes.
Thank you for cleaning my car.

295
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,800
And we're off the air.

296
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,500
That's the end of that.
It's been great.

297
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:47,133
No. The man who runs
the car valeting place
near me

298
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:49,067
has recently arrived
from Albania

299
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,833
and he's brilliant.

300
00:13:50,867 --> 00:13:52,833
And no one else is
gonna do it. He's superb.
That's what I meant.

301
00:13:52,867 --> 00:13:54,900
-Thank you very much.
-Fair enough. Fair enough,
well done, James.

302
00:13:54,933 --> 00:13:56,700
What I wanted to say is...

303
00:13:56,733 --> 00:13:58,733
I've noticed this driving
around in Britain, okay.

304
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:01,967
I've noticed a lot of
the new boys, people who've
just arrived in Britain,

305
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:05,267
don't seem to understand
how you use
the motorways here.

306
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,467
That the right-hand lane,
the outside lane,

307
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,100
is for overtaking.

308
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:10,700
And then when you've
completed your overtaking,

309
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:13,633
you then move back into
the two inside lanes again.

310
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:15,733
I mean, I'm just
passing that on as
a piece of information.

311
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:17,600
-No, because that's how
it works here. Exactly.
-Exactly.

312
00:14:17,633 --> 00:14:20,533
-Think of that right-hand lane
as the lavatory.
-Yeah.

313
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:22,367
You go in,
do what you gotta do...

314
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,933
-Mm-hmm.
-And then you come out again.

315
00:14:23,967 --> 00:14:26,500
You don't stay in there
all day.

316
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,133
Unless you're James May,
then I don't know what
you're doing in there.

317
00:14:29,167 --> 00:14:33,100
But actually, seriously,
you can't blame people for not
necessarily knowing that.

318
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:36,867
I mean, if you move to a
completely different country,
there's a lot of stuff

319
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,533
that you don't know
that you have to know.

320
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:41,367
Well, exactly.
We travel an awful lot,
as I'm sure you know.

321
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,100
In India, for example,

322
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,933
if you're behind a lorry
and it indicates right,

323
00:14:45,967 --> 00:14:48,400
that means,
"I have seen you

"Do please feel free
to overtake."

325
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,967
Or it means,
"I'm turning right."

326
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:55,633
HAMMOND: Yeah, it does.

327
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:57,433
And if only there'd been
a motoring show

328
00:14:57,467 --> 00:15:00,367
that would've told us
when we got there
that that's what it means.

329
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,867
-It's a valuable service.
-MAY: Yeah, exactly.

330
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,733
Because in Burma,
for example, if you turn
your headlights off,

331
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:08,067
that means it's night-time.

332
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:10,100
There's lots and lots of
different nuances

333
00:15:10,133 --> 00:15:11,767
-when you're driving
on the road.
-Cultural differences.

334
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,500
There's another one
in Britain, for people
who just got here.

335
00:15:14,533 --> 00:15:17,633
If you're stopped
by the police
for any reason,

336
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,433
erm, it's traditional
in Britain

337
00:15:19,467 --> 00:15:21,933
to cup the officer's face
and kiss him lightly.

338
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:24,767
-(LAUGHTER)
-Yeah. Yeah.

339
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,467
And quite often you'll find

340
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,067
he'll give you a traditional
little friendly punch
in the face.

341
00:15:29,067 --> 00:15:31,667

little tase along with it.

-NW8?
-Yes.

347

a London postcode?

will be the E17.

-I know it's a postcode.
I don't...

run over... How could a...

-Is he a driver?
-No, Hammond.
Look, this is...

00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:14,667
Hammond... Basically
the only band he knows
is The Wurzels.

360
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,167
That's the problem.

361
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,900
Now, I want to talk
about stopping distances.

362
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:20,167
We touched on this
when we were
in Australia last week.

363
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,800
You see, the government says

364
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:25,067
we have to be limited
to 70 miles an hour
on the motorway

365
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:29,700
because the stopping distance
from 70 is 315 feet.

366
00:16:29,733 --> 00:16:32,233
Which, they say,
that's an acceptable
stopping distance

367
00:16:32,267 --> 00:16:34,467
so therefore you can't go
any faster than 70.

368
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,133
Yeah, exactly. But we know
that it isn't 315 feet

369
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:39,133
because we demonstrated this
in Australia.

370
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,067
Well, from 60, yes,
but we're missing the point.

371
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,533
So what we were wondering is,

372
00:16:42,567 --> 00:16:45,333
how fast do you
actually have to be going

373
00:16:45,367 --> 00:16:48,367
before you need
315 feet to stop?

374
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,067
So we actually decided,
this morning, in fact,
to do an experiment.

375
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:55,200
We've got footage of it here.
It's The Stig driving along

376
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:58,633
in a diesel-powered
Vauxhall Insignia

377
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:01,600
and he's building up speed
to brake point now.

378
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:05,367
Full braking, and that's
The Stig doing it,
and there we are.

379
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,233
315 feet exactly.

380
00:17:07,267 --> 00:17:11,167
Anyone wanna guess
how fast he was going when
he pressed the brake pedal?

-(AUDIENCE MURMURING)

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

384
00:17:17,733 --> 00:17:20,167
No, try to be realistic.

385
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,567
110. Actually, he was doing
112 miles an hour.

386
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,633
So if the government says
that the speed limit
is determined

387
00:17:26,667 --> 00:17:28,100
by stopping distance,

388
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:31,967
then we should be allowed
to drive at 112 miles an hour.

389
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:35,100
HAMMOND: That's pure logic.
CLARKSON: You can't
argue with it.

390
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,533
It's logic.

391
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:41,367
Right, okay, now it's time
to get back to our
ambulance film.

392
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,067
So far we've established
that my car, his van
and his hearse

393
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:46,967
are faster than
the NHS equivalent.

394
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:48,433
And now we pick up the action

395
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:51,833
after we've converted them
into actual ambulances.

once more at our track

397

Hello, viewers,
and as you would expect,

399
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,667
I have done it properly.

400
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,233
This is no longer a hearse,

401
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:15,833
it is the future of club-class
recovery transport.

402

on business jet travel.

and it makes you feel better.

Look over there, nitrous.

457
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,600
Because, it has two purposes,

458
00:20:21,633 --> 00:20:23,800
it's what they use as
laughing gas in hospitals,
isn't it?

459

-Yes.
-So if the patient needs to be
made to feel a bit better,

I switch that to patient.

461
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,833
If I want to go a bit faster,
I switch that to engine

462

into the engine

Annoyingly, that's actually
quite clever.

487
00:21:31,967 --> 00:21:34,333
This is a split folding...
It's like a Range Rover
Porsche.

488
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:37,967
Don't sit on it!
You've already broken
one tailgate today.

489
00:21:38,067 --> 00:21:42,200
CLARKSON: And my brilliant
engineering didn't stop there.

490
00:21:42,233 --> 00:21:45,400
I'm driving down
a narrow street,

491
00:21:45,433 --> 00:21:47,933
parked cars are on either
side, I can't get through.

492
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,433
-Clear!
-HAMMOND: What?

493
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:53,267
(WHIRRING)

494
00:21:55,433 --> 00:21:59,067
-What... (LAUGHS)
-It's a ram-bulance!

495
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,733
-Oh, I see. I thought
it was a snow plough.
-Oh, my God.

496
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:03,967
-This is...
-Sheet steel.

497
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:05,200
-10-mil.
-Okay.

498
00:22:05,233 --> 00:22:06,200
(CLEARS THROAT)

499
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,400
-Heavy?
-Very.

500
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:09,500
Mmm.

501
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:11,367
That's why it folds back.

502
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,433
-Oh, what? 'Cause it's lighter
when it's folded.
-No. No. No. No. The...

503
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:16,167
-Do you know nothing about
weight distribution?
-50-50 weight distribution.

504
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,933
-(LAUGHS)
-Yeah, but it is still weight.

505
00:22:17,967 --> 00:22:20,067
CLARKSON: As we discussed
my handiwork,

506
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,133
a challenge arrived.

507
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,433
(CLEARS THROAT)

508
00:22:24,467 --> 00:22:27,700
"The Stig will now drive each
of your cars around the track,

509
00:22:27,733 --> 00:22:31,800
"which, to make it more real
has been fitted with
three speed humps.

510
00:22:33,067 --> 00:22:35,067
"You will be in the back
with a patient

511

00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,067
"you will put his
intestines back in,

00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,467
"insert a drip

00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,067
"Points will be

"and how much of

00:22:44,833 --> 00:22:46,867
"you complete successfully."

517
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,300
CLARKSON: What?

518
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,900
MAY: Is a catheter a thing
that goes up your old chap?

519
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:51,067
-Yes!
-MAY: Up it?

520
00:22:51,067 --> 00:22:52,667
-BOTH: Yes!
-Not on it?

521
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,500
-No!
-(LAUGHS)

522
00:22:55,533 --> 00:22:57,400
CLARKSON: Hammond elected
to go first

523
00:22:57,433 --> 00:22:59,600
and once his patient
had been loaded,

524
00:22:59,633 --> 00:23:03,633
a rather bemused Stig
took his place at the wheel.

525
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:06,100
-Oh, he's not in
a good way at all.
-He?

526
00:23:06,133 --> 00:23:07,467
-It's a girl.
-Oh, yeah.

527
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,267
Oh, no. Or is it though?

528
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,567
CLARKSON: It's a girl from
where I am. Just have
a look under there.

529
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,700
Or is that just a bit of...

530
00:23:12,733 --> 00:23:14,567
(SCREAMS) There's a thing.

531
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,067
CLARKSON: It's a lady boy.

532
00:23:16,067 --> 00:23:17,967
Anyway, it's a
medical emergency.

533
00:23:18,067 --> 00:23:19,600
Get out of the way.
I've got to get on with this.

534
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:26,800
In three, two, one, go!

535
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,200
Whoa, oh! (MUMBLES)

536
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:33,433
Erm, the wheels were
a mistake.

537
00:23:33,467 --> 00:23:38,067
I'm really sorry, mate.
Let's try and put your guts
back in the way they...

538
00:23:38,067 --> 00:23:39,500
(GROANS)

539
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,667
Airway, that's a priority.
That goes in here.

540
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,933
(BLABBERING)
He's being sick on me!
I'm covered in...

541
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:55,867
Stop vomiting, you idiot.

542
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:58,267
Ugh!

543
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,133
This is the willy bit.
You probably can't
see this on television.

544
00:24:02,167 --> 00:24:03,333
This has to go in the end.

545
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:07,100
Ahhh! No, I'm covered in wee!

546
00:24:10,233 --> 00:24:11,400
-Ugh!
-(EQUIPMENT SHATTERING)

547
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,267
Speed hump!

548
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,267
(GROANING)

549
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,067
That would have been deeply
uncomfortable for Hammond.

550
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,867
MAY: I would have
thought so, yeah.

551
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,467
How do I get
the blood out of the bag?

552
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:29,833
I'm tempted to
move back.

553
00:24:29,867 --> 00:24:32,367
Do you know, I agree.
Because it is Das Stig.

554
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,933
(GROANS) Stig!

555
00:24:37,067 --> 00:24:40,533
CLARKSON: There he is.
Across the line.

556
00:24:40,567 --> 00:24:45,367
The 2:17 lap
had taken its toll on both
the Chevy's brakes

557
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,233
and Dr Hammond.

558
00:24:47,267 --> 00:24:50,200
Holy moly!
Look at the state of him.

559
00:24:50,233 --> 00:24:53,367
-What's that?
-Being an ambulance man
is a tough job.

560
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,867
What is that?

561
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,500
-That's... It's wee.
-Is it yours?

562
00:24:56,533 --> 00:24:58,367
No.

563
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,933
CLARKSON: Next, it was
the turn of Dr Slow's
hearse-bulance.

564
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:04,567
Three, two, one, go!

565
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,967
(WHIRRING)

566
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:10,767
Should I start
the stopwatch now?

567
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,900
Well, this is part of the...

568
00:25:12,933 --> 00:25:14,500
Well, it's taking time.

569
00:25:17,067 --> 00:25:19,433
-Is his seat fastened down?
-Yeah.

570
00:25:19,467 --> 00:25:22,833
What he's done is
take a length of one of
those stair lifts...

571
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:28,133
(BOTH LAUGHING)

572
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,100
I think you may have overdone
it slightly on the closing of
the tailgate, Stig.

573
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:36,267
HAMMOND: Fasten it.
CLARKSON: You get in and
we'll fasten you in.

574
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,400
Your lap time is going
to be shocking, frankly.

575
00:25:38,433 --> 00:25:40,067
-You haven't started
the stopwatch?
-Yeah!

576
00:25:40,067 --> 00:25:41,900
-Of course we have.
-Well, I haven't set off yet.

577
00:25:41,933 --> 00:25:44,067
-You did set off!
-It's your call, isn't it?

578
00:25:45,867 --> 00:25:47,800
MAY: Hurry up! Go!

579
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,100
-He's gone!
-He's gone, then!

580
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,600
5:30 to get to there.
Not brilliant.

581
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:57,067
-Not brilliant.
-Can you hear me,
man, woman? No?

582
00:25:57,067 --> 00:25:59,300
Right!
Breathing, possibly not.

583
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:01,433
Putting...

584
00:26:01,467 --> 00:26:04,667
MAY: The hearse-bulance
coped brilliantly with
the corners.

585
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,600
That's his guts back in.

586
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:09,333
But less well on
the speed bumps.

587
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:10,900
(CREAKING)

588
00:26:15,167 --> 00:26:16,167
Ow!

589
00:26:17,933 --> 00:26:19,133
MAY: Keep going!

590
00:26:22,067 --> 00:26:23,300
He's going to make it.

591
00:26:23,967 --> 00:26:25,233
HAMMOND: Here he comes!

592
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:28,367
Hammond, run for your life!

593
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,933
I'm going to die!
Killed by ambulance.

594
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,867
Across the line.

595
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,700
HAMMOND: James wasn't best
pleased with his lap time.

596
00:26:36,733 --> 00:26:38,267
12 minutes...

597
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,933
-Oh, get lost.
-...and 28 seconds.

598
00:26:39,967 --> 00:26:43,467
-It was.
-It's the slowest lap
in Top Gear's history.

599
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,967
HAMMOND: Finally, it was
the turn of the Porsche.

600
00:26:46,067 --> 00:26:48,067
And immediately
there was a problem.

601
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,100
Ugh!

602
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:52,767
HAMMOND: Good.
MAY: He's kicked the patient.

603
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,733
-Erm...
-(ALL LAUGHING)

604
00:26:55,767 --> 00:26:57,300
CLARKSON: Shut up.

605
00:26:57,333 --> 00:27:00,067
HAMMOND: Eventually, though,
the ape was in position.

606
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,933
Begin!

607
00:27:04,467 --> 00:27:07,067
Is he focusing on
getting the drip in

608
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,900
or is he focusing on...

609
00:27:10,267 --> 00:27:12,267
* Trust in me

610
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:15,167
* Trust in me!

611
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,767
-(SHOUTING)
-(TYRES SCREECHING)

612
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,067
CLARKSON: Holy mother of God!

613
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:22,833
Oh.

614
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,933
Ow! That hurts so much.

615
00:27:29,067 --> 00:27:31,367
Damn. You maniac.

616
00:27:33,067 --> 00:27:35,500
Ow! You stupid man!

617
00:27:36,933 --> 00:27:39,600
Oh, God! What happens
if I go over a speed bump?

618
00:27:39,633 --> 00:27:41,867
I don't like this!

619
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,067
Oh!

620
00:27:49,633 --> 00:27:51,133
Here he comes.

621
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:53,333
I'm in a scene from Carrie.

622
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:58,133
I want Josh back
from Casualty.

623
00:27:59,633 --> 00:28:01,533
Oh, God!

624
00:28:02,533 --> 00:28:04,467
And across the line.

625
00:28:05,833 --> 00:28:08,667
Oh. Oh, dear.

626
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,200
CLARKSON: And then
to complete my humiliation...

627
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:14,400
2:24.

628
00:28:14,433 --> 00:28:15,500
Rubbish.

629
00:28:15,533 --> 00:28:16,633
What I was slower than the...

630
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:18,500
-(CHUCKLING) Yeah.
-He was...

631
00:28:18,533 --> 00:28:20,567
-2:12 or something,
weren't you?
-Yep.

632
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,067
-Did he slow down at all
for the speed humps?
-Nope.

633
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,900
That's why we got air.

634
00:28:25,933 --> 00:28:27,567
Might. That's my drawback.

635
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,067
Will you...

636
00:28:29,067 --> 00:28:31,567
I mean this is a Porsche.
You can't hit the speed...

637
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,800
It hasn't got
the clearance.

638
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:34,267
-Speed humps.
-He ripped his bumper off.

639
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,167
600,000 people a year

640
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,267
are killed in the back
of ambulances by speed humps.

641
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,900
What you're doing is
making that up.

642
00:28:40,933 --> 00:28:42,767
Yes, but it's making
a point as well.

643
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,233
Making it up to make a point.

644
00:28:44,267 --> 00:28:45,733
If it's one or more,
it's an issue.

645
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:47,967
-Go over it too fast,
patient dies.
-Agreed. Yeah.

646
00:28:48,067 --> 00:28:50,200
Slow down to make it
comfortable, the patient dies.

647
00:28:50,233 --> 00:28:51,633
'Cause they don't reach
the hospital in time.

648
00:28:51,667 --> 00:28:55,767
Until this government
gets rid of every single
speed hump,

649
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,233
we're all going to die.

650
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:02,300
For our next test,
we had to see
which of our cars

651
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:06,200
had the fastest
patient-offloading system.

652
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:08,267
As I approach
the A & E department,

653
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,133
I open the boot
using electricity.

654
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:13,833
I then apply the handbrake,
hydraulic,

655
00:29:13,867 --> 00:29:15,633
the car swings round,

656
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:19,900
centrifugal force causes
the patient to leave the car,
the ambulance,

657
00:29:19,933 --> 00:29:21,267
on his stretcher,

658
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:25,300
the wheels deploy and
he rolls into the hospital.

659
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:27,533
I am then pointing
in the right direction

660
00:29:27,567 --> 00:29:29,833
to go back out
and get another patient.

661
00:29:31,567 --> 00:29:34,533
Somewhere there is a world
in which that will work.

662
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:37,067
CLARKSON ON PA:
Ambulance one coming in hot.

663
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:39,067
Delivery system engaged.

664
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,467
Behold my genius.

665
00:29:47,367 --> 00:29:49,300
Not an enormous success.

666
00:29:49,333 --> 00:29:50,933
MAY: No, I could see
where the thinking was going,

667
00:29:50,967 --> 00:29:53,867
but the legs didn't deploy
and the patient's dead.

668
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,067
CLARKSON:
Goal line technology,
that is in.

669
00:29:57,067 --> 00:29:58,567
MAY: I'm going
to give it a no.

670
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,367
On the basis that
he isn't in the hospital.

671
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,767
-He is!
-MAY: He's not.

672
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,033
-CLARKSON: He is.
-Even his foot's not in.
He's not in...

673
00:30:04,067 --> 00:30:05,400
-The stretcher.
-Nobody's gonna
look at that and say,

674
00:30:05,433 --> 00:30:07,267
"Oh, that poor man
is in hospital."

675
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,400
They're gonna say,
"That poor man's been dumped
outside a hospital."

676
00:30:10,633 --> 00:30:12,233
HAMMOND: It was then my turn.

677
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:13,967
Swing it around.

678
00:30:14,933 --> 00:30:16,133
What is he doing?

679
00:30:16,167 --> 00:30:18,700
Similar sort of system,
only I'm using a cannon.

680
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,833
And, er, ready? Good. Fire!

681
00:30:23,733 --> 00:30:25,800
Pretty quick.
I think you'll agree.

682
00:30:26,667 --> 00:30:27,900
What?

683
00:30:27,933 --> 00:30:29,267
CLARKSON:
What the hell was that?

684
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,033
Not entirely certain

685
00:30:31,067 --> 00:30:33,933
you've delivered the patient
to the hospital.

686
00:30:33,967 --> 00:30:35,767
-Oh, I have.
-Or...

687
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,933
That the patient is still...

688
00:30:36,967 --> 00:30:38,100
What's the word
I'm looking for?

689
00:30:38,133 --> 00:30:39,867
-Alive.
-MAY: Yeah, that's the one.

690
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,500
HAMMOND: Oh. Oh, dear.

691
00:30:42,433 --> 00:30:43,667
That was an air cannon.

692
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,100
Oh, and the door
didn't open properly.

693
00:30:47,067 --> 00:30:49,200
MAY: Given how low
the bar had been set...

694
00:30:49,233 --> 00:30:50,833
HAMMOND: I think
it was a good idea.

695
00:30:50,867 --> 00:30:53,000
MAY: ...I was confident
that I'd win this.

696
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,933
CLARKSON:
James, what exactly
are we looking at?

697
00:30:57,967 --> 00:31:00,300
-This is a robot lawn mower.
-CLARKSON: Is it?

698
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:01,867
I've laid out
pieces of string.

699
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:07,067
It knows where those are
so it mows only inside
this big rectangle.

700
00:31:07,067 --> 00:31:10,067
So, then I thought,
you know the really big
farm lawn mowers?

701
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:12,767
-You mean combines.
-Yeah, whatever.

702
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,500
Those work off satnav.

703
00:31:14,533 --> 00:31:15,867
The satnav knows where it is.

704
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,233
And that's the technology
I've used.

705
00:31:18,267 --> 00:31:20,867
HAMMOND:
We watched eagerly
as James lined up

706
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,567
to demonstrate his invention.

707
00:31:24,167 --> 00:31:25,333
-(DOOR WHIRRING)
-CLARKSON: Oh, God.

708
00:31:43,467 --> 00:31:44,700
MAY: Right.

709
00:31:44,733 --> 00:31:46,667
Now all I do is,
using my special
programmer,

710
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,533
I have the coordinates
of the operating theatre

711
00:31:48,567 --> 00:31:51,100
-of this hospital
already entered.
-(SATNAV BEEPING)

712
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,267
-(CLARKSON LAUGHING)
-Now, watch.

713
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:00,133
MAY: Stand clear.

714
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:02,900
What, so you uploaded
the schematics

715
00:32:02,933 --> 00:32:06,567
to your PDA of the hospital
like Jack Bauer?

716
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,167
(SATNAV BEEPING)

717
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,900
-What does that mean?
-Arrived at the
operating theatre.

718
00:32:10,933 --> 00:32:12,433
-Does it?
-Yes.

719
00:32:12,467 --> 00:32:15,400
In some ways,
I'm very impressed
with what he's done.

720
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,467
Yeah.

721
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,300
But in one colossal way,

722
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:23,267
I'm not sure that
it's worked at all.

723
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,433
I know what that way is.

724
00:32:25,467 --> 00:32:27,867
And I think you're right,
it is a disadvantage

725
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,467
of the system. It's a problem.

726
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,300
James, would you like to know
what the massive... What?

727
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:34,333
If you insist
there's something
wrong with it.

728
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,067
HAMMOND: Yeah.
Maybe your patient
changed his mind.

729
00:32:41,333 --> 00:32:44,600
-(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
-CLARKSON: Thank you,
thank you.

730
00:32:44,633 --> 00:32:47,767
Thank you so much, everybody!
Now, we'll pick that up...

731
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,500
We'll pick that up later on.

732
00:32:49,533 --> 00:32:53,733
Er, but now it is time
to put a star in our
reasonably-priced car.

733
00:32:53,767 --> 00:32:57,933
My guest tonight
is a Formula One driver
who is always smiling.

734
00:32:57,967 --> 00:33:00,933
But he says that behind
the cuddly exterior

735
00:33:00,967 --> 00:33:03,067
is actually a bit
of a honey badger,

736
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:07,267
a ferocious animal
that fights its opponents
by going for their...

737
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,500
Crotch areas.

738
00:33:08,533 --> 00:33:09,700
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Er...

739
00:33:09,733 --> 00:33:12,967
So, ladies and gentlemen,
please put your hands

740
00:33:13,067 --> 00:33:15,867
over your genitals
for Daniel Ricciardo!

741
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,233
Hey!

742
00:33:20,367 --> 00:33:22,267
-RICCIARDO: G'day.
-How are you?

743
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,067
I'm all right.

744
00:33:25,267 --> 00:33:26,867
CLARKSON: Yes.

745
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,333
People love it when
an F1 driver comes.

746
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:32,200
Ahh.

747
00:33:32,233 --> 00:33:34,533
It was weird. We were in
Australia last week,
in the Northern Territories,

748
00:33:34,567 --> 00:33:36,533
saw no Australians at all,

749
00:33:36,567 --> 00:33:37,933
and now there's one here.

750
00:33:37,967 --> 00:33:39,833
Yeah, I know. It's...

751
00:33:39,867 --> 00:33:41,733
But in the end you're
all over here, actually,
if we're honest, aren't you.

752
00:33:41,767 --> 00:33:43,967
Well...
Not by choice.

753
00:33:44,967 --> 00:33:46,333
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

754
00:33:47,367 --> 00:33:50,633
I can feel the warmth
you're generating there.

755
00:33:50,667 --> 00:33:52,467
No. Erm, what I wanted to do,

756
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,467
is obviously,
when you started
at Red Bull last year,

757
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,167
did you think,
and I know a lot
of people did,

758
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,767
that you'd be
the cheerful Aussie
playing second fiddle

759
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,867
to the four-times
world champion,
Sebastian Vettel?

760
00:34:03,533 --> 00:34:05,067
-No.
-You didn't.

761
00:34:05,067 --> 00:34:08,200
So you actually thought
from the get-go,
"I'm going to have him."

762
00:34:08,233 --> 00:34:11,433
I believed
I'd have him, but I...
Yeah.

763
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:14,367
Until I got on track
and had everything
like-for-like,

764
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,433
I wasn't obviously sure
how it would go,

765
00:34:16,467 --> 00:34:18,867
but coming into it
I didn't expect to be,

766
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,533
you know, the guy
following him every weekend.

767
00:34:20,567 --> 00:34:24,267
You know,
obviously came in with
some self-belief and then

768
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,600
I think that sort of showed
and then confidence grew
after that, so.

769
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:31,067
There were 19 races last year
and you beat him in how many?

770
00:34:31,067 --> 00:34:33,367
-I don't know. Er...
-I do.

771
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,767
How many was it?
(LAUGHS)

772
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,367
-Fourteen of them.
-14.

773
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,667
-Don't pretend
you did not know that.
-(LAUGHING)

774
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,733
No, I...
I didn't really, actually.

775
00:34:40,767 --> 00:34:43,500
I knew it was more,
like I knew I had
more than him.

776
00:34:43,533 --> 00:34:45,067
Yeah, no,
you outqualified him in?

777
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,533
You going to pretend
you don't know that as well?

778
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:48,267
Er, wait, this one's, er...

779
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,733
12-7?

780
00:34:49,767 --> 00:34:51,367
-11-8.
-11-8.

781
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,600
But you really,
you're not keeping that
in your head?

782
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,067
I would be.
I'd ring him up
every morning and go,

783
00:34:56,067 --> 00:34:57,700
-(CHUCKLING) "11-8."
-(RICCIARDO LAUGHING)

784
00:34:57,733 --> 00:34:58,800
He changed his number.

785
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:00,500
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

786
00:35:00,533 --> 00:35:03,533
I think one of the reasons
we were all surprised,
I think,

787
00:35:03,567 --> 00:35:07,233
when you first started and
were immediately brilliant
in the Red Bull,

788
00:35:07,267 --> 00:35:09,800
is that you just don't look
particularly ruthless.

789
00:35:09,833 --> 00:35:11,700
I mean,
you're always smiling.

790
00:35:11,733 --> 00:35:14,633
Your photographs, we'd been...
I looked through to see
if I could find you,

791
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:16,867
one of you not smiling. Ever.

792
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,500
Have a look at this,
okay, because...

793
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:22,267
-This is winning in Canada.
That's a huge beam, yes?
-Yeah.

794
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:26,100
And this is after
you'd been disqualified
in Australia.

795
00:35:27,867 --> 00:35:29,300
And then we have another
photograph of you having

796
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:31,500
some kind of blood test
with a horrible injection.

797
00:35:31,533 --> 00:35:32,867
-Ah, yeah.
-Here we are.

798
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,533
CLARKSON: Still!

799
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:37,133
You know,
it looks like a smile,
but that's pain right there.

800
00:35:37,167 --> 00:35:39,467
Is it? So you smile
when you're in agony.

801
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,200
Maybe if we see the lap later,
there might be some, er...

802
00:35:44,233 --> 00:35:46,967
Some different emotions.
'Cause it was
an open-faced helmet

803
00:35:47,067 --> 00:35:48,533
in the little Suzuki.
So maybe you'll see...

804
00:35:48,567 --> 00:35:50,667
Well, we'll see if we
can capture a moment
when you're not smiling.

805
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,300
But that is later on.

806
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:55,333
-Now, obviously testing
is happening now, in fact.
-Yeah.

807
00:35:55,367 --> 00:35:56,433
-As we speak.
-Yep.

808
00:35:56,467 --> 00:35:58,167
In fact,
how come you're not there?

809
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,433
Top Gear's way more important.

810
00:35:59,467 --> 00:36:01,133
-Really?
Ooh, we're all in a...
-Yeah.

811
00:36:01,167 --> 00:36:03,700
-I hate testing.
I can't stand it.
-Really?

812
00:36:03,733 --> 00:36:05,400
Ah, no, I wouldn't say
I hate it, but...

813
00:36:05,433 --> 00:36:08,900
Now there you see it.
The old machine's come
off the rails now.

814
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:12,667
And how's it going? I suppose
we've got some Formula One
fans here, inevitably,

815
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,900
and they'll want to know
how's it going.

816
00:36:13,933 --> 00:36:16,067
Are you going to be
as fast as the Mercs?

817
00:36:16,067 --> 00:36:19,833
It's still very early.
I mean, we are
still finding out our way

818
00:36:19,867 --> 00:36:23,167
but we've still got
eight more days in Barcelona
after this, so...

819
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,667
Come Melbourne
we'll be right.

820
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,367
Has anybody else...
'Cause I think
it's only fair,

821
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,500
there's a lot
of Formula One fans.
Anyone got any questions

822
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:32,133
they'd like to ask Danny
while he's here and we're
talking about Formula One?

823
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:34,067
MAN 1: What's the back
of Lewis's car look like?

824
00:36:35,533 --> 00:36:36,867
Can you see that?

825
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,367
(LAUGHING)

826
00:36:38,867 --> 00:36:40,233
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

827
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,900
Anyone else got
another question?

828
00:36:46,933 --> 00:36:48,633
MAN 2: Who's better,
you or Webber?

829
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:50,367
(LAUGHS) Er...

830
00:36:51,833 --> 00:36:53,867
I don't know.

831
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,900
Actually, let's...
We'll find out.

832
00:36:56,933 --> 00:36:58,833
I believe he's 1.43.1, so...

833
00:36:58,867 --> 00:37:01,267
CLARKSON: He is on the board.
Because this is
the only time ever

834
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,467
when Formula One drivers
get to actually drive
the same machine.

835
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,533
Same equipment.
Different day,
one could argue.

836
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:08,633
-The pressure is on,
if I'm honest today...
-I know.

837
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:10,933
-Because in particular...
-My heart rate's going up.

838
00:37:10,967 --> 00:37:14,600
Yeah, well, I mean, so's mine,
because I actually said
early last year,

839
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:17,133
I actually sent a tweet out
saying I thought you were

840
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:19,933
the best driver
on the F1 grid.

841
00:37:19,967 --> 00:37:21,300
Knuckles. Thanks.

842
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,733
It's my way
of saying thank you.

843
00:37:26,767 --> 00:37:29,833
Oh, it says thank you.
I thought you'd hit me.

844
00:37:29,867 --> 00:37:33,067
And it's not... I mean,
people who know what they're
talking about as well said it.

845
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,900
Alonso said...
What did he call you?

846
00:37:34,933 --> 00:37:37,767
He said you were
unbelievable.

847
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,500
Yeah, so we have had
this sort of...

848
00:37:39,533 --> 00:37:41,900
How good is Daniel?
And this is
your opportunity to come

849
00:37:41,933 --> 00:37:45,600
and actually show everybody,
in the same car
they've all driven.

850
00:37:45,633 --> 00:37:47,667
And the weather today was...

851
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:51,267
It was good.
Like, that's the thing,
I don't have excuses.

852
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,367
-No, it was cold
and bright and...
-Dry.

853
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,433
About as perfect
as it can be
for a car.

854
00:37:56,467 --> 00:38:00,633
So who would like to see
what is, let's be honest,
an extremely important lap?

855
00:38:00,667 --> 00:38:02,333
AUDIENCE: Yeah!

856
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:04,433
-Play the tape.
Let's have a look.
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

857
00:38:04,467 --> 00:38:06,067
C'mon.
Let's do this.

858
00:38:06,067 --> 00:38:09,333
Obviously you're back
in the old car,
the Suzuki Liana.

859
00:38:09,367 --> 00:38:10,800
Nice to see it back.

860
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:13,133
Race face on.
(GROWLS)

861
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:16,067
CLARKSON: That is.
It's like a honey badger.

862
00:38:16,067 --> 00:38:17,333
I'm guessing,
are you gonna go...

863
00:38:17,367 --> 00:38:19,333
No, really, you're not
on the wide line

864
00:38:19,367 --> 00:38:21,067
taken by most other
Formula One drivers.

865
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,833
RICCIARDO: Taking it tight.
Taking it tight.

866
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:25,767
CLARKSON: You are.
RICCIARDO: Just
saving distance.

867
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,100
CLARKSON: Not there
you're not.

868
00:38:27,133 --> 00:38:29,133
Chicks would go
crazy for this.

869
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,800
CLARKSON: Okay, this is it.

870
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:34,167
Good understeer.

871
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,800
CLARKSON: A little bit
but managed nicely.

872
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:36,867
RICCIARDO: Hit it tight.

873
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,967
Whoo!
Let's go, let's go.

874
00:38:40,567 --> 00:38:43,267
CLARKSON: All sorts of
hand gestures.
RICCIARDO: Good racing.

875
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,833
CLARKSON: Hammerhead.
RICCIARDO: Keeping it
in the lines...

876
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:49,333
CLARKSON: Yeah,
now getting it all lined up
for a smooth, quick...

877
00:38:49,367 --> 00:38:51,133
Why am I telling you
what you're doing?

878
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:52,933
That would...
You know what you're doing.

879
00:38:54,067 --> 00:38:55,933
Come on. (GROWLS)

880
00:38:57,533 --> 00:39:00,400
CLARKSON:
Are you suggesting
this isn't fast enough?

881
00:39:00,433 --> 00:39:02,133
Look at it.
Using the red
and whites there...

882
00:39:02,167 --> 00:39:03,600
This line's good.
This is...

883
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,333
This is racing.

884
00:39:05,367 --> 00:39:07,633
CLARKSON: Oh,
that's keeping it comfy.
RICCIARDO: Yeah.

885
00:39:07,667 --> 00:39:10,800
CLARKSON: Keeping it comfy...
Oh, look at that
lift-off oversteer.

886
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:13,067
RICCIARDO: Yeah!

887
00:39:13,067 --> 00:39:14,967
CLARKSON: That's something
our other guests should use.
Lift-off oversteering there.

888
00:39:15,067 --> 00:39:17,100
RICCIARDO: Oh, that was...
CLARKSON: And then
just fling it in.

889
00:39:17,133 --> 00:39:18,300
And there we are,
across the line!

890
00:39:26,567 --> 00:39:28,400
-Oh.
-(CLARKSON CHUCKLING)

891
00:39:30,467 --> 00:39:33,867
-I'm actually nervous.
-Go on, then. Where do you
think you've come?

892
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,567
These are effectively
the dry times.

893
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,800
Jenson, 1.44, 1.44, 1.44,

894
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,700
1.40...
And so we're up to...

895
00:39:39,733 --> 00:39:42,200
Lewis then came along
on his second attempt

896
00:39:42,233 --> 00:39:43,900
-and did...
-(EXHALING NERVOUSLY)

897
00:39:43,933 --> 00:39:48,067
Let's be honest,
a fairly unbeatable
1.42.9.

898
00:39:48,067 --> 00:39:50,133
'Cause that's...
What, is he quicker...
Mark's second,

899
00:39:50,167 --> 00:39:52,567
-so he's .2 second off.
-The anticipation's
killing me.

900
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,500
And then we're right down
to Seb at 1.44.

901
00:39:56,467 --> 00:39:58,600
Should I just go lower, or...

902
00:39:58,633 --> 00:40:00,000
I don't know. The gap...

903
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,067
I don't know. The gap...
The gap between
Webber and Vettel

904
00:40:00,067 --> 00:40:01,600
The gap between
Webber and Vettel

905
00:40:01,633 --> 00:40:04,400
scares me,
like that's a big gap,
so I'm wondering...

906
00:40:04,433 --> 00:40:06,033
That's .9 of a second.

907
00:40:06,067 --> 00:40:07,567
...did they have good
track conditions,
did I have that...

you and your smile in there.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

910
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,700
Just do it slowly.

911
00:40:12,733 --> 00:40:14,133
Lewis went 1.42.9...

912
00:40:14,167 --> 00:40:17,233
Do it slow, like
one number by one number.

913
00:40:17,267 --> 00:40:21,000
Okay? I don't wanna...
If I've lost,
I wanna lose slowly.

914
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,467

I'm letting you down gently,
is what I'm doing. 1...

921

Do it slow.

-2.
-Yes!

Ah... My hair's
standing on end,

927
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,067
'cause it's another 2.

928
00:41:02,067 --> 00:41:04,900
I mean, seriously,
a 1.42.2.

929
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:12,067
Fabulous.
Absolutely stunning.

930
00:41:12,067 --> 00:41:14,833
How'd you do that?
How did you do that?

-CLARKSON: Unbelievable.
-(RICCIARDO LAUGHS)

That's the fastest
anybody's ever gone round
our track.

933
00:41:27,567 --> 00:41:29,133
(SIGHS) I feel way better.

934

In any of our
reasonably-priced cars.

935
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:37,333
It'll be fun next year
when you get back
on the circuit

936

with that time.

937
00:41:38,633 --> 00:41:41,800
That is genuinely remarkable.
I'm staggered.

938
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:44,567
Because I'm, Lewis...
Lewis has hung himself.

939

Oh, and by the way...

-By the way, matey boy,
you wanna...
-Yeah.

(ALL LAUGHING)

942
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,567
In the same car,
it turns out,

943
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,533
that the Aussie
has just beaten the Brit.

944
00:41:55,567 --> 00:41:57,533
It's the Ashes all over again.

945
00:41:57,567 --> 00:42:00,833
This is how I felt
after Canada.
I didn't know what to say.

946
00:42:00,867 --> 00:42:03,733
So we've actually
made a man happier
than winning a Grand Prix.

He's done it!
Daniel Ricciardo!

949
00:42:09,633 --> 00:42:12,900
CLARKSON: Just,
I'm really, that's...
I would applaud.

950
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,433
You know that wasn't
a fluke, don't you.

951
00:42:17,467 --> 00:42:20,433
No, he did three laps,
exactly the same time.

952
00:42:20,467 --> 00:42:21,500
-Really.
-Three times.

953
00:42:21,533 --> 00:42:24,200
-That's why he's...
-Yeah. Yeah.

954
00:42:24,233 --> 00:42:27,633
Now, tonight
we have made
three ambulances

955
00:42:27,667 --> 00:42:30,267
and to be honest,
there have been
a few niggles

956
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,433
-and minor teething troubles.
-Yeah.

957
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:37,967
For example, not one of them
has yet delivered a patient
to hospital alive.

958
00:42:38,067 --> 00:42:41,333
No. Nevertheless,
the producer said we had to
go off and build

a Thunderbirds- style
International Rescue facility

960
00:42:44,433 --> 00:42:47,167

on hand, with our ambulances,

ready to respond
at a moment's notice.

we were waiting
for our first emergency.

No, honestly,
I'm not joking.
It's unbelievable.

968

The NHS response time in
Britain for a life-threatening
situation is eight minutes.

969

in New York, which is busy,
in four minutes.

-That's from the call?
-That's from the call.

Four minutes later,
they're there.

There's 1,000 of them
in New York, okay?

973

And they're normal people.

They are builders,

MAY: Following my encounter
with the infernal Peugeot,

1144
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,067
I had also thrown
caution to the wind.

What's this?

-(DEVICE BEEPS)
-Cock.

-(DEVICE BEEPS)
-Cocking Nora.

1152
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,300
Might have lost
a few seconds in that.

1153
00:53:48,367 --> 00:53:49,500
HAMMOND: Oh, no.

1154
00:53:49,533 --> 00:53:51,900
I've got a Porsche ambulance
behind me.

1155
00:53:51,933 --> 00:53:53,833
Hammond, get out of my way!

1156
00:53:53,867 --> 00:53:56,167
I'm coming through
in a Porsche Turbo!

1157
00:54:00,067 --> 00:54:02,433
Brakes are definitely failing.

00:54:26,833 --> 00:54:28,233

Hammond has stuffed it.

1169
00:54:42,267 --> 00:54:43,833
Nearly there.

1170
00:54:43,867 --> 00:54:46,167
Sorry about the noise.
You'll be fine.

near the hospital now.

Oh, yes!

1176
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:05,433
First at the hospital.

1177
00:55:07,933 --> 00:55:09,900
That is a victory.

1178
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,433
Damn it! May is already there.

1179
00:55:22,467 --> 00:55:25,067

He got better.
-Did he?

1187

-Yeah.
-Did he?

1188
00:55:54,967 --> 00:55:57,633
I did say, did I not,
at the beginning
of this item,

1189
00:55:57,667 --> 00:56:00,467
the process of recovery begins
in the club class ambulance

1190
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,367
and, in fact, it worked.

1191
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,067
-James, where is he?
-In the pub, I imagine.

1192
00:56:05,067 --> 00:56:07,067
-He can't be in the pub,
he was wounded!
-Why not?

1193
00:56:07,067 --> 00:56:09,200
He was dying
and got 10 minutes to live.

Thank you.

00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:43,600
Well, there we are.

1203
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:46,067
Despite Hammond's
catastrophic failure
at the end there,

1204
00:56:46,067 --> 00:56:50,433
I think there were a number
of very important points
made in that film.

1205
00:56:50,467 --> 00:56:51,867
But now we must work out

1206
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,400
which of our ambulances
was the best.

1207
00:56:54,433 --> 00:56:57,133
Absolutely, and over here
we have the scoreboard.

1208
00:56:57,167 --> 00:56:58,933
And we start
with the drag race.

1209
00:56:58,967 --> 00:57:00,967
-Now, Jeremy, you won that.
-I did.

1210
00:57:01,067 --> 00:57:03,067
So you get 10 points.

1211
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,567
Uh, I came second,
I get 5.

1212
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,733
Richard Hammond,
you were last,

1213
00:57:06,767 --> 00:57:09,067
and for that,
you get nought.

1214
00:57:09,067 --> 00:57:11,833
Yep, okay, fair enough.
Then we move on to lap times.

1215
00:57:11,867 --> 00:57:13,367
Now, remember,
you get a point

1216
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,867
for every second
your ambulance got
round the track

-Yes.

1228

that let you down badly.

1229
00:57:41,933 --> 00:57:44,233
All right, never mind.
Let's move on,
medical procedures.

1230
00:57:44,267 --> 00:57:46,500
Now, uh, I performed
two of those,

1231
00:57:46,533 --> 00:57:50,200
you get 7 points for each one,
so I got 14 points.

1232
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:53,400
Richard Hammond,
you actually performed three,

1233
00:57:53,433 --> 00:57:55,500
so you get 21 points.

1234
00:57:55,533 --> 00:57:57,633
Uh, no, hang on a minute.
I did four,

1235
00:57:57,667 --> 00:58:00,567
because I did the intestines,
the catheter, the drip

1236
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,867
and I did the airway.

1237
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,533
Yeah, but you weren't
asked to do the airway.

1238
00:58:03,567 --> 00:58:05,633
-Yes, but I did it.
-You could've done
a breast enlargement,

1239
00:58:05,667 --> 00:58:07,567
it wouldn't have made any
difference to your points.

1240
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,067
You were asked to do three
things, you did them,

1241
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,733
now stop moaning.
What did I get?

1242
00:58:10,767 --> 00:58:12,067
Yeah, well, this is
the interesting thing,

1243
00:58:12,067 --> 00:58:14,067
because you, I'm afraid,
got nought.

1244
00:58:14,067 --> 00:58:16,367
Oh, that's 'cause
I was rather transfixed

1245
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,767
by my patient's...thing.

00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:23,867
I went round one corner,
it nearly went in my mouth.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-Yes.

1250
00:58:25,533 --> 00:58:26,967
That would've been bad.

Let's move on to value.

1252
00:58:28,833 --> 00:58:32,133
-Uh, Richard Hammond, yours
was the most expensive.
-It was.

1253
00:58:32,167 --> 00:58:33,667
-Can you believe it?
-I know. Well...

1254
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,067
-Difficult, but, uh,
you get nought.
-HAMMOND: Yeah.

1255
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:38,867
Uh, Jeremy Clarkson, yours
was very slightly cheaper,

1256
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:40,933
-so you get 5.
-CLARKSON: Yeah.

1257
00:58:40,967 --> 00:58:44,300
Mine was very much cheaper,
at just £1,800,

1258
00:58:44,333 --> 00:58:45,733
I get 10.

1259
00:58:45,767 --> 00:58:46,967
CLARKSON: 10 points there.

1260
00:58:47,067 --> 00:58:49,067
-OK, moving on.
Now, sirens.
-Yeah.

1261
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:51,400
Mine, uh, was rubbish,
really, I'll confess.

1262
00:58:51,433 --> 00:58:53,533
-It was.
-Yeah, it was.
So I get nought there.

1263
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:55,133
CLARKSON: It was childish
and rubbish.

1264
00:58:55,167 --> 00:58:57,067
Jeremy, yours didn't
work either, did it?

1265
00:58:57,067 --> 00:58:58,800
Oh, it didn't.
Wasn't childish,
it just didn't work.

1266
00:58:58,833 --> 00:59:00,067
HAMMOND:
It was rubbish.

1267
00:59:00,067 --> 00:59:06,967
James, you get
minus 461 for that one.

1268
00:59:07,067 --> 00:59:08,367
How do you work that out?

1269
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,833
Well, because not only
was your siren inaudible,

1270
00:59:10,867 --> 00:59:12,767
but it doesn't actually
say "ambulance"

1271
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:14,100
on the front
of your ambulance.

1272
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:15,767
-Yes, it does!
-It doesn't.

1273
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,500
It doesn't, because,
look, you've written
the word backwards,

1274
00:59:17,533 --> 00:59:19,933
but you've got the letters
the right way around still.

1275
00:59:19,967 --> 00:59:22,700
Yes, I know, but the
shop where I went

1276
00:59:22,733 --> 00:59:25,600
didn't have back-to-front
ambulance lettering.

1277
00:59:25,633 --> 00:59:27,600
Yes, yes, and
as a result of that,

1278
00:59:27,633 --> 00:59:30,367
you are now on
exactly minus 1,000.

1279
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,667
-Yes, you are.
-That's absolutely remarkable.

1280
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:34,600
That's incredible.
Incredible maths,
but there we are.

1281
00:59:34,633 --> 00:59:37,333
It doesn't matter,
I'm gonna claw
something back here.

1282
00:59:37,367 --> 00:59:38,767
The race to the hospital.

1283
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:41,067
Yeah, you are.
Because you came first.

1284
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:42,833
-Mmm-hmm.
-For that, you get 10 points.

1285
00:59:42,867 --> 00:59:46,733
-Jeremy, you came second,
so it's 5 points for you.
-Yes.

1286
00:59:46,767 --> 00:59:48,633
And I came stone-dead last,

1287
00:59:48,667 --> 00:59:51,067
so I get no points
on that particular one.

1288
00:59:51,067 --> 00:59:52,500
Oh, now look, here we are.

1289
00:59:52,533 --> 00:59:53,900
James is back to...

1290
00:59:53,933 --> 00:59:56,100
Yeah, minus 990.

1291
00:59:56,133 --> 00:59:57,933
HAMMOND: Yeah, I know.
He's catching up.

1292
00:59:57,967 --> 00:59:59,300
Right, delivery systems.

1293
00:59:59,333 --> 01:00:02,033
Now, mine it didn't
really work, did it?

1294
01:00:02,067 --> 01:00:04,333
No, well, your door
didn't work one time,

1295
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:06,567
and you fired a man through
a window the second time,

1296
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:07,767
so that's definitely no.

1297
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:09,400
Yeah, that did happen.

1298
01:00:09,433 --> 01:00:12,567
James, you didn't actually
have a patient to deliver.

1299
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:13,933
No, you didn't.

1300
01:00:13,967 --> 01:00:16,367
HAMMOND: So I'm afraid
you get minus 10 for that.

1301
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,133
Oh, no. All gone wrong.

1302
01:00:20,167 --> 01:00:22,200
Yeah, Jeremy, yours did work.

1303
01:00:22,233 --> 01:00:24,867
It did, so you get 5 points.
Right.

1304
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:27,567
So hang on a minute.
Hang on, hang on, hang on...

1305
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,967
This is close.

1306
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,367
Not with you, obviously,
James, but Hammond and I,

1307
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,867
I'm only now...

1308
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:35,267
I'm only three points
behind you.

1309
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,100
-Yeah, you are.
-And we arrive at this bit.

1310
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:40,433
OK, this is the condition of
the patient when he arrived...

1311
01:00:40,467 --> 01:00:42,600
Well, I say "he",
the "she", whatever it was.

1312
01:00:42,633 --> 01:00:44,233
-...arrived at the hospital.
-Yeah.

1313
01:00:44,267 --> 01:00:47,133
So, ahem, here we go.
James May...

1314
01:00:47,167 --> 01:00:49,700
-Yes.
-Your patient condition was...

1315
01:00:49,733 --> 01:00:50,933
Missing.

1316
01:00:50,967 --> 01:00:52,200
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

1317
01:00:52,233 --> 01:00:54,567
-Yes. Presumed dead.
-Yeah.

1318
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,100
-Yeah, dead.
-So you score...

1319
01:00:56,133 --> 01:00:57,967
-Uh, nought.
-Right, nought.

1320
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,067
-The condition of
Hammond's patient?
-Dead.

1321
01:01:01,067 --> 01:01:03,733
-Right, so he scores...
-Nought.

1322
01:01:03,767 --> 01:01:06,700
Ahem, and the condition
of my patient?

1323
01:01:06,733 --> 01:01:08,967
Your patient, Jeremy,
was alive.

1324
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:13,200
-And so I score...
-One.

1325
01:01:15,333 --> 01:01:16,433
What do you mean, one?

1326
01:01:16,467 --> 01:01:19,467
It's nought for dead,
one for alive.

1327
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:22,067
I was the only one
of the three of us

1328
01:01:22,067 --> 01:01:24,600
who got a patient
to a hospital alive,

1329
01:01:24,633 --> 01:01:25,833
and that matters!

1330
01:01:25,867 --> 01:01:27,533
Yes, and that's why
you got that point.

1331
01:01:27,567 --> 01:01:30,833
So you're saying that because
I only get one point, I'm...

1332
01:01:30,867 --> 01:01:34,400
That means
I now lose to you,

1333
01:01:34,433 --> 01:01:39,067
even though your van
was slow, expensive,

1334
01:01:39,067 --> 01:01:41,367
its brakes caught fire
every time you tried
to slow down,

1335
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,967
and it killed everybody
who got into the back of it.

1336
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:45,833
Yep.

1337
01:01:45,867 --> 01:01:48,233
And the only reason you won
is because you happened to be

1338
01:01:48,267 --> 01:01:50,567
good at putting a tube
in a ladyboy's sausage.

1339
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:51,833
Yep.

1340
01:01:51,867 --> 01:01:53,333
Which means that you,
Richard Hammond,

1341
01:01:53,367 --> 01:01:57,300
have single-handedly ruined
the National Health Service.

1342
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:58,967
Yep.

1343
01:01:59,067 --> 01:02:01,500
And on that bombshell,
it's time to end.

1344
01:02:01,533 --> 01:02:02,933
Thank you so much
for watching.

1345
01:02:02,967 --> 01:02:04,467
See you again next week.
Good night.
