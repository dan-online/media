It's been a good night so far.</font>

10
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,240
<font size="36">Yeah, it's been really good, yeah.</font>

11
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,640
<font size="36">I'll be honest, when Julie suggested
we get together, I was like, "No!"</font>

12
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,040
<font size="36">I get set up a lot by friends
and it never works out.</font>

13
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,840
<font size="36">Oh, tell me about it. Me too.
You know, I hate dates usually.</font>

14
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,080
<font size="36">They should call dates, "spend
some time with a big, fat loser."</font>

15
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,640
<font size="36">But this has been brilliant.</font>

16
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,360
<font size="36">Hey, um, I was thinking afterwards,
maybe you'd like to come</font>

17
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,160
<font size="36">back to my place. We could listen
to the new Jamie Cullum album.</font>

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,680
<font size="36">Maybe, yeah. Yeah, yeah... That
would be really nice actually.</font>

<font size="36">Great.</font>

20
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,240
<font size="36">Let me guess, um,
you're a red wine person.</font>

21
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,840
<font size="36">Yes, yes, I am.</font>

22
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,280
<font size="36">Oh, I would be too if we could
get some service round here!</font>

23
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,760
<font size="36">Yeah, you, Hucknall,</font>

24
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,560
<font size="36">when you're simply red-y.</font>

25
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,600
<font size="36">Unbelievable!</font>

26
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,640
<font size="36">Oh, I should say,</font>

27
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,120
<font size="36">I don't really like sharing, so you
get what you want, I'll get what</font>

28
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,760
<font size="36">I want, we'll leave it at that.
I just think it's less confusing.</font>

29
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,720
<font size="36">Sure, sure. Did you say Jamie Cullum?</font>

30
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,600
<font size="36">Yeah. Yeah, I hate Jamie Cullum.</font>

31
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,720
<font size="36">"Oh, and just to say,</font>

32
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,400
<font size="36">"I don't really like sharing," with
the rising inflection and everything.</font>

he doesn't like sharing!</font>

34

<font size="36">What the heck is tapas?
You know tapas, tiny food from Spain.</font>

35
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,040
<font size="36">Oh, yes, tape-as?
That's not how you say it.</font>

36
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,000
<font size="36">Yes, it is.
You're a tape-as.</font>

37
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,480
<font size="36">What else? What else?</font>

38
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,680
<font size="36">What else? Oh, God, you should have
seen him with the waiters.</font>

39
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,840
<font size="36">Rude?
Unbelievable.</font>

40
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,800
<font size="36">I used to work as a waiter.
If anyone was ever rude to me,</font>

41
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,440
<font size="36">I used to carry
their food around in my trousers.</font>

42
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,240
<font size="36">Oh, my God, before you
brought it to their table?</font>

43
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,760
<font size="36">No, after.</font>

44
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,560
<font size="36">Of course before!
Why would I do it after?</font>

45
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,760
<font size="36">Well, do you think
they did that to him?</font>

46
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,520
<font size="36">OK, well, while he was eating,
did you hear anyone laughing,</font>

47
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,920
<font size="36">like in the kitchen area?
Yes! Yes, I did actually. Yes, I did.</font>

48
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,320
<font size="36">That will be trouser food!
Oh, God!</font>

49
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,480
<font size="36">Probably a good thing
you weren't sharing.</font>

50
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,160
<font size="36">Oh, my God!</font>

51
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,680
<font size="36">I could have saved you the trouble.
That guy is famous, he's a mouth.</font>

52
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,400
<font size="36">They call him The News because
he's talks about who he slept with.</font>

53
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,320
<font size="36">I would honestly rather
sleep with a rat, literally.</font>

54
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,480
<font size="36">The thing I can't understand yeah,
this, this is a man Julie on fifth</font>

55

I mean, what was she thinking?</font>

56
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,000
<font size="36">Wait, who do you know on fifth?</font>

57
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,280
<font size="36">Why?
Judy or Julie?</font>

58
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,840
<font size="36">Why do you need to know?
No reason.</font>

59
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,280
<font size="36">Lots of nice looking girls on fifth.
Looking for an in, are we?</font>

60
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,200
<font size="36">An in? No, thank you. No.</font>

61
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,400
<font size="36">Don't use my name to start leching
around on fifth.</font>

62
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,200
<font size="36">For your information,
I do not lech.</font>

00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,880
<font size="36">I just can't believe it.</font>

120
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,360
<font size="36">Well, I'd hardly make up
something like that!</font>

121
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,600
<font size="36">No, of course, of course not.</font>

122

<font size="36">Oh, God!</font>

123
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,680
<font size="36">Well, she was a bit off
at the restaurant.</font>

124
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,720
<font size="36">I mean, was it the food?
The tapas, do they know?</font>

125

we all have to go sometime.</font>
