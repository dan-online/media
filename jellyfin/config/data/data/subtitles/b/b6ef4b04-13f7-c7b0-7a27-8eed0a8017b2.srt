<font size="36">to do something good. Yeah?</font>

148
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:43,367
<font size="36">It's like Comic Relief.</font>

149
00:07:43,434 --> 00:07:47,167
<font size="36">Yeah? I'm out here in Africa,</font>

150
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48,968
<font size="36">and I'm seeing the flies and the starvation.</font>

151
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:51,067
<font size="36">And she, if she is the boss,</font>

152
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:54,467
<font size="36">she's in the studio with, you know, Jonathan Ross and Lenny Henry,</font>

153
00:07:54,534 --> 00:07:55,801
<font size="36">and they've got their suits on. They're doing their bit,</font>

154
00:07:55,868 --> 00:07:57,567
<font size="36">they're counting the money. Good luck to them.</font>

155
00:07:57,634 --> 00:08:00,934
<font size="36">But their hands are clean, while I'm down here in the office</font>

156
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,300
<font size="36">with little starving kids.</font>

157
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:04,968
<font size="36">-Yeah. -Right (CLEARS THROAT).</font>

158
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:07,968
<font size="36">Since the last meeting, Alan and the board have decided</font>

159
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:10,767
<font size="36">that we can't justify a Swindon branch and a Slough branch.</font>

160
00:08:10,834 --> 00:08:13,267
<font size="36">-Oh! Okay, go on. -No, now listen, David. Don't panic.</font>

161
00:08:13,334 --> 00:08:15,167
<font size="36">DAVID: Should be good. This is it. Go on.</font>

162
00:08:15,234 --> 00:08:17,434
<font size="36">-There are alarm bells. -No, listen to me. No, don't panic.</font>

163
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,634
<font size="36">-We haven't made any deci... -Don't panic?</font>

164
00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:21,367
<font size="36">-We haven't made any decisions yet. -Good.</font>

165
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,133
<font size="36">I've spoken to Neil in Swindon.</font>

166
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,267
<font size="36">-I've told him the same as you. -Yeah.</font>

167
00:08:25,334 --> 00:08:27,167
<font size="36">And it's up to either you or him</font>

168
00:08:27,234 --> 00:08:29,968
<font size="36">to convince me that your branch could incorporate the other.</font>

169
00:08:30,033 --> 00:08:32,734
<font size="36">-Okay. No problem. -This does, however, mean</font>

170
00:08:32,801 --> 00:08:34,300
<font size="36">that there are going to be redundancies.</font>

171
00:08:34,367 --> 00:08:37,500
<font size="36">Oh, you see? Did I no want to hear that, Jenny,</font>

172
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:40,367
<font size="36">because redundancies are a tragedy, always.</font>

173
00:08:40,434 --> 00:08:43,000
<font size="36">I wouldn't wish that on Neil's men. I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men...</font>

174
00:08:43,067 --> 00:08:44,934
<font size="36">Or women.</font>

175
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,367
<font size="36">Present company excepted. Is Neil concerned about redundancies?</font>

176
00:08:47,434 --> 00:08:49,000
<font size="36">Well, he is. Of course, yes.</font>

177
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:51,100
<font size="36">Good. Because I'm very concerned about redundancies.</font>

178
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:53,300
<font size="36">Although I understand if they're absolutely necessary, as a businessman.</font>

179
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,701
<font size="36">-Does he understand...? Go on. -David.</font>

180
00:08:55,767 --> 00:08:57,267
<font size="36">-Can we not talk about redundancies? -Well...</font>

181
00:08:57,334 --> 00:08:59,467
<font size="36">-What we have to decide... -We have to, sooner or later.</font>

182
00:08:59,534 --> 00:09:01,734
<font size="36">Yes, but at the moment, what we have to decide</font>

183
00:09:01,801 --> 00:09:06,067
<font size="36">is do you take on Swindon's people at this branch or the other way round?</font>

184
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:07,133
<font size="36">Yeah, we'll take on theirs.</font>

185
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,334
<font size="36">-(LAUGHS) No. -No?</font>

186
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,601
<font size="36">-No. You and I don't decide. -Decide?</font>

187
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:12,534
<font size="36">-I decide. -You do decide, but...</font>

188
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:14,567
<font size="36">-Once you've made your case. -Based on factors.</font>

189
00:09:14,634 --> 00:09:16,167
<font size="36">Okay. Is there a time limit on...</font>

190
00:09:16,234 --> 00:09:18,734

<font size="36">-David? -I wasn't.</font>

202
00:09:38,734 --> 00:09:40,500
<font size="36">Can we keep a lid on this for the time being?</font>

203
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:42,968
<font size="36">I really don't want to worry people unduly.</font>

204
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:46,634

205
00:09:46,701 --> 00:09:49,200

206
00:09:49,267 --> 00:09:51,367
