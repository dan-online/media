1
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,620
'Tonight, I move my eyes...

2
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,980
'..Richard vandalises a road...'

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:17,060
There you go.

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,780
'..and James says, "Cow." '

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:19,780
Cow!

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,580
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

7
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,220
Hello.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,100
Hello, good evening, and welcome.
Thank you so much.

9
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:37,460
Now, this is a mobile telephone.

10
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,580
It's fully functional

11
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,460
and what I'm going to do...

12
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,860
is throw it in that lavatory.
LAUGHTER

13
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,500
I know that's the first time
you've ever seen a programme

14
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,820
start that way, but bear with me,

15
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,980
because if we now look...

16
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,300
Yeah, it's only been in the water
for a few seconds,

17
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,060
but it's ruined for ever.
LAUGHTER

18
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,100
If you wanted to communicate
with somebody,

19
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,900
you'd be better off using
a Brussels sprout.

20
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,340
LAUGHTER

21
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,660
Of course, because if you expose
your phone to any form of moisture

22
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,740
or heat or dust or vibration,
it will break.

23
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,660
It's not just phones,
it's everything -

24
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,740
printers, laptops, Wi-Fi routers.

25
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,180
My coffee machine breaks even
when you expose it to coffee.

26
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,260
LAUGHTER

27
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,420
Anything with a circuit board is
as reliable as a Greek accountant.

28
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,660
LAUGHTER

29
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,100
It is. Except, weirdly, except cars.

30
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,420
Now, we were talking about this
in the office the other day,

31
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,700
and there was a bit of an argument.

32
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,540
We were saying you can drive a car
across the Sahara, the Arctic,

33
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,940
you can run it through hurricanes
and dust storms and it'll be fine.

34
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,940
Hmm, but the producers
are saying

35
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,780
that because modern cars are
so complex and so electronical,

36
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,460
they are bound to suffer from
reliability problems

37
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,860
like everything else.

38
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,100
Right,
so to see who is correct,

39
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,540
the producers said to us,

40
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,980
"Go out and each choose
your favourite modern GT car,

41
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,260
"and then report with them
to what's billed

42
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,500
"as the most hirsute and manly
proving ground of them all -

43
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,500
"Austria."

44
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,140
No, James, Australia.

45
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,940
LAUGHTER

46
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,020
Same thing.

47
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,660
'This is the hirsute and manly
proving ground in question...

48
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:28,900
'..the vast, almost completely
uninhabited Northern Territory,

49
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,180
'better known as the outback.

50
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,900
'Richard had chosen to take on
this brutal and enormous wilderness

51
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,020
'in a car that was designed
for the car park at Old Trafford -

52
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,620
'a Bentley Continental GT.

53
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,540
'James had gone for a car engineered
for the velvet smoothness

54
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,580
'of the world's racetracks -
a Nissan GT-R.

55
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:08,780
'And I was in the ultimate
Monaco-to-Munich mile-muncher -

56
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,340
'the BMW M6 Gran Coupe.'

57
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,780
I tell you what.

58
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,340
What?
I think this is the first time

59
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,940
in all of Top Gear's history,

60
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,500
where all three of us
like all three of the cars.

61
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,460
Normally, I go, "Yours is rubbish,
and you've made the wrong decision,

62
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,500
"and I'm the only one
who's done it properly."

63
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,540
It's a good point, actually,
cos I do like your car

64
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,180
and I do like your car, Hammond,
and I like my car, obviously.

65
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,980
It's a GT-R.
You can't not like a GT-R.

66
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,260
If you like driving above all else

67
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,100
and to the exclusion of
all other considerations,

68
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,980
you have to have one of these.

69
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,180
If you have a Ferrari
or a Lamborghini,

70
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,860
what you're saying is, "I'm not
that interested in driving."

71
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,820
It's showing off.
It's showing off.

72
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,300
Speaking of which,
the Bentley Continental...

73
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,740
Now, what happened there?

74
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,620
We used to think it was a bit dull,
but now it's sort of good.

75
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,220
But it was overnight. It was.
We all must have woken up...

76
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,940
I hate the Bentley Continental.
I hate the Bentley Continental.

77
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,900
I hate the Bentley Continental.
God, I love the Bentley Continental.

78
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,180
I don't understand that. Cos they
haven't changed the styling much.

79
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,540
It's been around a while now.

80
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,540
But then you just woke up
one morning and went,

81
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,860
"That looks really good."

82
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,500
I'd actually have a yellow one
as well. It looks tremendous.

83
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,420
But while we're on the subject
of styling...a-hem, a-hem, a-hem!

84
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,620
Oh, how we mocked when they said
they were going to do this.

85
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,660
Right, so you are going to do
a four-door version

86
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,900
of a two-door version
of a four-door saloon car?

87
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,740
And then it came out and you just
thought, "That is so good looking."

88
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,780
I love that back wheel. That dished
back wheel looks so fantastic.

89
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,340
Almost a double-bubble roof.

90
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,460
I know it's carbon fibre,
which is a little bit...

91
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,460
We can gloss over that.
But, God, it looks good.

92
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,540
'As we continued our three-car
love-in, a challenge arrived.'

93
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,220
Here we go.

94
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:02,260
"You will drive to a farm,
which is four days from here."

95
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,540
Everything is four days
from everything in Australia!

96
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:10,180
"And when you arrive you will use
your cars to round up 4,000 cows."

97
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,780
But... Can you do that?

98
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,860
"The farm is a big one.
Three million...."

99
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,500
Three million acres?! No, it's not.
You read that wrong.

100
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,300
It's in words. It's in words, yeah.

101
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,780
Three... It's not...? Are you
sure...? It isn't 300,000?

102
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,780
Three million in the country?
That's a big farm.

103
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:28,900
Never mind that. Rounding up
4,000 cows using... These.

104
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,220
HE GASPS

105
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:33,340
Oh, God, James, what have you done?

106
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,140
What's he done, what?

107
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,980
As we know, there is a strong
republican movement in this country,

108
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,460
people who think it's ridiculous
to have a head of state

109
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,860
living in London
on the other side of the world.

110
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,380
He turns up here
with that on the number plate.

111
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,540
What?

112
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,820
Can you not see that? It's obvious.

113
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,260
No. "Charles and Camilla."

114
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,300
You've done it on purpose,
haven't you, James?

115
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,740
Let me explain.
You blithering idiot. You idiot!

116
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,340
Oh, no! Mine says, "Big Royalist."

117
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,220
It does. It totally does.
You can see it.

118
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,420
"Big Royalist."

119
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,940
Luckily, mine just says BMW 001,

120
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,900
cos I've covered myself
on this occasion.

121
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,660
No, you idiot. "Bloody Mrs Windsor."

122
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,620
Oh, no! "Bloody Mrs Windsor."

123
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,060
We're in trouble now!
How could he possibly know?

124
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,260
I rang them up
and said, "Can you provide a car?

125
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,900
"Can you make sure the number plate
doesn't say 'convict'

126
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,100
"or anything on it?"

127
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,740
And they've done that!

128
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:29,020
We're going to have
to drive through...
We'll be stoned by republicans.

129
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,900
'As we set off, though,
we had a more immediate problem.

130
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,060
'Could our complicated cars
really cope

131
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,180
'with this vast,
superheated dust bowl?'

132
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,420
Vauxhall once thought they'd try
and sell the Senator in Australia,

133
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,980
a big old saloon
made in Germany in the '80s.

134
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,620
So they shipped one out here
and it lasted a couple of days

135
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,140
and then it split in half.

136
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,860
Split in half!

137
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,340
That's how brutal the outback is.

138
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,380
This car has
electronic valve control,

139
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:12,140
electronic gearbox control,
an electronic differential.

140
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,460
Everything is electronic.

141
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,420
It actually has a sensor
in the engine that adjusts
