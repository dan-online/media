is different.

When I say "different,"
I mean "wrong."

those different thoughts.

the only thing we agree on

- is "steering wheel."
- Yeah.

But then they go and put it

It must be really annoying
having to drive along

Why don't you just put it
in front of the driver
like we do?

It's probably a good idea
if we get on with
the actual show.

Yes, it is. But we had
to clear all that up,

some people have been saying,

No, Barbados is definitely
another exception.

more "car-y" if it tried.

The thing is, though,

192
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:25,505
various supercar makers
have now taken

193
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:29,342
the polar-bear-friendly
technology from a Prius,

194
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:33,146
and they are now using it
to create raw, naked speed.

00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,416
Now, I say the best
of these hybrid hypercars

196
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:40,787
is the mad,
swivel-eyed McLaren P1.

197

Whereas Richard Hammond,
who's wrong--

198
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:43,991
I'm not wrong.

the best

200
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:49,462
is actually the rather
boring Porsche 918.

201
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:51,999
- It's not boring!
- Yes, it is.

- It isn't.
- Mm-hmm.

203
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:55,535
It isn't.
Well, whatever.

204
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:59,106
We decided to meet up
with the cars

205
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:01,574
and settle this
once and for all.

206
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:04,237
The location we chose
 for this titanic duel
 was Portugal...

207
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:09,176
specifically,
 the international
 race track of the Algarve.

208
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:18,318
When we arrived,
 mechanics from Porsche

209
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:20,453
and McLaren pounced on
 our cars,

210
00:15:20,453 --> 00:15:23,523
fettling them for
 what was to come.

211
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:26,593
And this meant Hammond and I
 had some time to indulge

212
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:30,597
in a spot
 of childish point scoring.

213
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,833
Which one of these is going
to be the fastest around
this track?

214

- This?
- Yeah.

Apart from this one,
which will be faster.

216

It won't. Which one do you
think will be the fastest?

- This one.
- This one.

will be fastest.
McLaren say the McLaren.

219

How much is it
if I wanted to buy one?

220
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:50,583
I think one was sold in
an auction for 1.8 million.

221
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:54,621

- Yes. It is thousands.

Why has your car
got a number on the side?

It's the Weissach edition,
this one.

- You also get
titanium chassis bolts.
- Stupid.

For just an extra £60,000.

And a carbon-fiber

Look at that.
How much does that save?

- About 100 grams.
- Right there, 100 grams.

231
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:19,779
Has the McLaren got
a carbon-fiber bonnet strut?

232
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:23,150
- Doesn't need one.
- No, because my bonnet
doesn't go up

233
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,552
because it will never
break down.

 there's no run-off area

BMW has ever made.

And we found one.
We shipped him to England

are quite strong.

views, for example,

with fewer than eight cylinders.

- Or more than eight cylinders.

- Or cars that have
their engine in the middle.

Everything that isn't American
really with a V8 is communist.

00:43:20,932 --> 00:43:23,268
Looking utterly bewildered.

688
00:43:25,003 --> 00:43:28,306
But he's off.
 A skitter of a wheel spin.

689
00:43:28,306 --> 00:43:30,742
And immediately
 he's onto the Isn't Straight.

690
00:43:30,742 --> 00:43:33,211
There is a right there
 that will have confused him.

691
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:34,746
Now a left,
 he'll be good at that.

692
00:43:34,746 --> 00:43:35,781
Now he can open the taps.

693
00:43:35,781 --> 00:43:40,251
Three liters, six cylinders.

694
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:41,953
This thing wouldn't pull
a greasy string

695
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:43,855
out of a dog's ass.

696
00:43:43,855 --> 00:43:48,727
JEREMY: I've literally no
 idea what he's talking about.

697
00:43:48,727 --> 00:43:51,462
Where I come from,
this ain't a car.

698
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:53,699
It's a cry for help.

699
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:55,533
JEREMY: Whatever.

700
00:43:55,533 --> 00:43:57,903
He's through the final corner
 on the Isn't Straight.

701
00:43:57,903 --> 00:44:00,706
Into Your Name Here.
 Hard on the brakes.

702
00:44:00,706 --> 00:44:02,708
Grabbing the stick,

703
00:44:02,708 --> 00:44:04,710
which is on the left-hand
 side of where he's sitting,

704
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:06,177
and turning in.

705
00:44:06,177 --> 00:44:08,379
See what I mean?
 No understeer at all.

706
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:10,481
Damn tracks are narrower
than my driveway.

707
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:13,284
Yeah, that's 'cause it doesn't
 have a monster truck on it.

came up with this thing.

00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:20,358
The tall one? The short one?
Or the one with the girly hair?

00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:23,561
JEREMY: Okay, coming up
 to Old Lady's House.

Turning in, round
 the unexploded bomb,

00:44:27,933 --> 00:44:30,568
and now opening
 the taps again.

714
00:44:30,568 --> 00:44:33,104
No turbo lag at all,

715
00:44:33,104 --> 00:44:35,506
as he hammers down
 the bumpy back straight

716
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,342
towards Sub Station.

717

00:44:41,046 --> 00:44:44,082
One more 90-left to go
through Field Of Sheep.

720
00:44:44,082 --> 00:44:47,185

And across the line.

To make sure that the M2--

726
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,968
that wasn't on the lap board
all by itself,

727
00:45:02,968 --> 00:45:06,004
we got the American to put
other benchmark cars--

728
00:45:06,004 --> 00:45:10,141
we call them benchmark cars,
he calls them communist--

729
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:12,177
around the track,
to see what's what.

730
00:45:12,177 --> 00:45:14,112
There they all are:
McLaren, Audi and so forth.

731
00:45:14,112 --> 00:45:16,314
Hang on a minute.
We saw a Ferrari 488

732
00:45:16,314 --> 00:45:17,783
at the track
in the film earlier on.

733
00:45:17,783 --> 00:45:19,017
Why isn't that on there?

734
00:45:19,017 --> 00:45:21,186
Because Ferrari
wouldn't let us time it.

735
00:45:21,186 --> 00:45:23,088
- Wouldn't let us?
- No.

736
00:45:23,088 --> 00:45:25,791
So the Ferrari LaFerrari
can't go on the road

737
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:28,259
- or run on electric only?
- No.

738
00:45:28,259 --> 00:45:30,128
And the 488
can't do a timed lap?

739
00:45:30,128 --> 00:45:32,663
Ferrari are quite tricky to
deal with from time to time.

740
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:35,901
Let's just put it that way
and move on. It's time to see

741
00:45:35,901 --> 00:45:38,236
where the M2 goes
on that board.

Let's put it on.

- Yes, it's--
- The one you should have,

00:45:57,823 --> 00:46:00,091
if you want one that's slower
than all the other M cars.

00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:02,427
It's better.
It's only two seconds--

751
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:05,396
- It's quicker than a Civic.
- Yeah.

752
00:46:05,396 --> 00:46:07,032
But it's slower than--

of M cars, lined them up,

"I'd like the fastest,"
it wouldn't be that one.

- I have.
- It's fabulous.

It's a brilliant car.
It really honestly is.

00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,530
And his new film is called
 Nocturnal Animals.

856
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:07,565
We haven't had time,
unfortunately,

857
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:09,500
to organize
a dramatic entrance,

858
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:12,337
but I hope you'll give him
a warm welcome nevertheless.

859
00:51:12,337 --> 00:51:14,739
Ladies and gentlemen,
Armie Hammer!

860
00:51:15,973 --> 00:51:17,842
There he is.

861
00:51:18,943 --> 00:51:20,978
Oh, my...

862
00:51:20,978 --> 00:51:22,680
Jesus!

863
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,482
Is that a snake?

864
00:51:24,482 --> 00:51:26,384
- It's a snake.
- That's a rattlesnake.

865
00:51:26,384 --> 00:51:28,386
- Is it?
- Yeah.

866
00:51:28,386 --> 00:51:31,289
He's being killed.
Quiet, everyone.

867
00:51:31,289 --> 00:51:33,324
Quiet, please.

868
00:51:33,324 --> 00:51:35,360
There's literally
nothing we can do.

869
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,395
He's yards away from us.

870
00:51:37,395 --> 00:51:39,063
Snakes are like herds
of them.

871
00:51:39,063 --> 00:51:41,766
- They hunt in packs.
- Yeah, they're pack animals.

872
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:44,535
Does that mean
he's not coming on either?

873
00:51:44,535 --> 00:51:47,805
No, James, he's finished
writhing around in agony.

874
00:51:47,805 --> 00:51:49,840
And now he's dead.

875
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,876
So that is a no.

876
00:51:51,876 --> 00:51:53,711
Well, uh...

877
00:51:53,711 --> 00:51:56,281
maybe there's somebody famous
in the audience.

878
00:51:56,281 --> 00:51:58,283
That's unlikely.

879
00:51:58,283 --> 00:52:00,751
No. Seriously,
you know Carol Vorderman?

880
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:03,321
She rang me this morning
from an air show nearby

881
00:52:03,321 --> 00:52:06,357
and said,
can she come to the show?

882
00:52:06,357 --> 00:52:08,359
I know you don't know
who Carol Vorderman is.

883
00:52:08,359 --> 00:52:10,895
She's a huge, huge,
huge star in the UK.

884
00:52:10,895 --> 00:52:12,930
She started out on
a program called Countdown

885
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:15,200
and established herself as
being unbelievably brilliant,

886
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,202
a fantastic mathematician

887
00:52:17,202 --> 00:52:19,237
and very beautiful.

888
00:52:19,237 --> 00:52:22,540
Yes, she's also dead.

889
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:24,074
What?

890
00:52:24,074 --> 00:52:27,878
- What?
- She's dead.

891
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:30,648
- How did that happen?
- I don't know.
I'm not a pathologist!

892
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:33,284
But she's dead
is what she is.

893
00:52:33,284 --> 00:52:35,286
- Seriously?
- Yes!

894
00:52:35,286 --> 00:52:38,289
- Christ.
- Problem.

895
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:40,591
What are we gonna do?

896
00:52:40,591 --> 00:52:41,859
Um...

897
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:44,229
Jesus, look at that out there.
It's like a--

898
00:52:44,229 --> 00:52:45,863
It's just littered
with corpses.

this bit is working.

We'll do it again in
South Africa next week,

904
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:59,744
and I think people will
have forgotten all this.

905
00:52:59,744 --> 00:53:02,513
- They might not.
- I think they will.

906
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:04,949
We'll just skip over it now.
It's not gonna happen.

907
00:53:04,949 --> 00:53:07,285
That's okay, 'cause we
can back to the cars.

- Yes, don't look.

910
00:53:14,091 --> 00:53:15,460
This week--

911
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,762
This week we are trying
to find out

912
00:53:17,762 --> 00:53:20,531
which of the new breed of
hybrid hypercars is the best.

913
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:22,900
Yes. On day one
at the track in Portugal,

914
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,404
we established that
the McLaren P1 is a mentalist,

915
00:53:26,404 --> 00:53:30,174
that the Porsche 918
is a very good milk float,

916
00:53:30,174 --> 00:53:33,444
and that the Ferrari LaFerrari
can do nothing at all.

917
00:53:34,345 --> 00:53:36,381
Some of that is true.

918
00:53:36,381 --> 00:53:39,484
But now, day two.

919
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,629
JEREMY:
 We began by lining up

920
00:53:51,629 --> 00:53:54,365
the three most exciting cars
 on the planet

921
00:53:54,365 --> 00:53:58,002
for the drag race
 of all drag races.

922
00:54:12,016 --> 00:54:15,686
Naturally, this meant
 engaging launch control,

923
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:20,024
which in the McLaren
 takes about a fortnight.

924
00:54:20,024 --> 00:54:24,094
I have to have the drive tray
in track mode,

925
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,331
the aero package
in sport mode,

926
00:54:26,331 --> 00:54:27,665
so that the rear end squats

927
00:54:27,665 --> 00:54:29,634
when I set off
and gives me more traction.

928
00:54:29,634 --> 00:54:32,870
I have to have the DRS
button pressed with my thumb

929
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:36,874
to keep the rear wing open
which reduces drag obviously.

930
00:54:36,874 --> 00:54:39,977
Launch control in the Porsche,
left foot on the brake hard.

931
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:42,012
Right foot
on the throttle hard.

932
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:44,349
Light goes green, left foot
off brake. Pa-ching!

933
00:54:44,349 --> 00:54:46,751
Launch button,
press for two seconds.

934
00:54:46,751 --> 00:54:49,520
Left foot on brake.
Right foot on throttle.

935
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,956
Press launch control,
mash the throttle,

936
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:54,759
within four seconds
release the brake.

937
00:54:54,759 --> 00:54:57,995
Three seconds later,
I have full boost,

938
00:54:57,995 --> 00:55:00,431
and I have to set off
within three seconds

939
00:55:00,431 --> 00:55:02,833
or the entire system
disengages.

940
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:05,603
I'm going to get this wrong.

941
00:55:05,603 --> 00:55:07,638
Just so you know.

942
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:09,940
I've got a lot to do in here.

[BEEP]

945
00:55:36,401 --> 00:55:39,169
I wasn't ready.

00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,939
Oh, my God!
That is quick!

947
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:49,947
Holy mother!
Did you see that?

948
00:55:49,947 --> 00:55:53,183
[BLEEP] me!
Jesus [BLEEP] Christ!

949
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:55,119
It's all over the place.

950
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:03,060
Since it was clear I'd got
 all my buttons wrong,

951
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:06,497
the chaps agreed
 to another run.

952
00:56:06,497 --> 00:56:08,533
Sit rep,
the lights went green

953
00:56:08,533 --> 00:56:10,601
before the boost was ready,

954
00:56:10,601 --> 00:56:12,770
and I had the DRS button
still pressed

955
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:15,440
when I got to the end,
which meant I had no downforce,

956
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,643
which meant--
Well, poo came out.

957
00:56:18,643 --> 00:56:22,713
This time I'm gonna do it
with more drag,

958
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:25,315
which will slow me down,
but I will be able to stop

959
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:27,452
without killing myself.

960
00:56:29,454 --> 00:56:32,457

00:56:50,475 --> 00:56:52,543
And we are away!
What a start!

00:56:55,312 --> 00:56:57,715

to a flyer.

230 kilometers an hour.

969
00:57:14,198 --> 00:57:16,967
That wasn't very good.

970
00:57:16,967 --> 00:57:20,204
Because James had
 somehow messed up that time,

971
00:57:20,204 --> 00:57:22,673
and because this test
 was about the cars,

972
00:57:22,673 --> 00:57:25,209
we decided to go again.

973
00:57:30,347 --> 00:57:31,782
It's a rocket ship.

974
00:57:33,518 --> 00:57:35,620

And again.

983
00:58:11,956 --> 00:58:15,760
That's a different result
again.

984
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,895
JEREMY: And again?

985
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,369
At this point,
 we decided to call

986
00:58:25,369 --> 00:58:26,937
a halt to proceedings,

987
00:58:26,937 --> 00:58:31,609
because we had reached
 a scientific conclusion.

988
00:58:31,609 --> 00:58:35,045
It turns out it doesn't really
matter which car you buy,

989
00:58:35,045 --> 00:58:37,281
it all depends on your shoes.

990
00:58:37,281 --> 00:58:38,983
Now, this is a TOD loafer.

00:58:42,052 --> 00:58:44,254
off the brake pedal,
and it's immediate.

00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:47,191
- This is a Converse.
- There's more sponge
in there than I thought.

994
00:58:47,191 --> 00:58:50,160
See, Adidas, they weren't
thinking that through.

995
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,330
- So, as you lift
your foot up--
- It's a millisecond.

996
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:54,699
I know you've got KERS,

997
00:58:54,699 --> 00:58:56,266
I know you've got
a 6.3-litre V12,

998
00:58:56,266 --> 00:58:58,836
and I know that launch
control system is amazing,

999
00:58:58,836 --> 00:59:00,237
but it's all let down

1000
00:59:00,237 --> 00:59:02,206
by the sponginess
of the Adidas shoe.

1001
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:04,441
So they should sell you
the car and the shoes.

1002
00:59:04,441 --> 00:59:06,977
No, have you got the correct
shoes and have you worn them in?

1003
00:59:06,977 --> 00:59:09,013
- Exactly.
- Fresh shoes, lads.

1004
00:59:09,013 --> 00:59:13,217
- I just need to--
- You need to skid about.
There we go.

1005
00:59:13,217 --> 00:59:15,820
With that sorted,

1006
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:18,055
it was time to bring in
 a racing driver

1007
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:21,926
to see which of our cars
 could do the fastest lap.

Our resident American
 said he wasn't interested,

1009
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:28,265
because all three cars
 are probably communist.

00:59:28,265 --> 00:59:31,636

 for a Belgian chap--

Jerome took the cars out

 they handled.

And when he'd finished,

1017
01:00:06,837 --> 01:00:08,639
we were interested to hear

It's wasting rubber and fuel.

It's about the same speed
as a Golf diesel,
something like that.

Here he is.

- James, if you want
to get a cup of tea.
- We've warmed the track.

RICHARD: Next it was the turn
 of the Porsche 918.

1043
01:03:03,848 --> 01:03:06,350
How much faster will it go
because of the stripes?

1044
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:07,351

Way, way,
way slower than him.

Don't forget between here
and the next measuring point,

1050
01:03:43,921 --> 01:03:46,590
Okay, you've got
four slow corners,

1051
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:49,259
and those are the ones
where the Porsche
is gonna make up time.

1052
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:52,362
Because of the
four-wheel steering.

1053
01:03:52,362 --> 01:03:56,033
- Like a Honda Prelude?
- No!

1054
01:04:09,646 --> 01:04:12,449
- 110 point what?
- One.

1055
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:16,386
So, almost to a tenth
of a kilometer an hour,
the same speed as you.

 to take a massive gamble.
