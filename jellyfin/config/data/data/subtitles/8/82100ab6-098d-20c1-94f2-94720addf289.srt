00:10:23,004 --> 00:10:24,254
On the lower levels.

178
00:10:24,338 --> 00:10:26,380
I'm fine, but I don't know for how long.

179
00:10:26,463 --> 00:10:27,588
Droids are everywhere.

180
00:10:27,672 --> 00:10:29,630
Obi-Wan and I are on board, too.

181
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:31,755
What? What are you doing here?

182
00:10:31,838 --> 00:10:33,880
We came to get you off this ship.

183
00:10:33,963 --> 00:10:35,755
Ahsoka, how can we get to the senator?

184
00:10:36,254 --> 00:10:37,380
According to our scans,

185
00:10:37,463 --> 00:10:40,463
there seems to be a large open area
in the center of the ship.

186
00:10:40,838 --> 00:10:42,963
It should be halfway
between the two of you.

187
00:10:43,046 --> 00:10:44,254
We're on our way.

188
00:10:44,338 --> 00:10:45,505
Did you hear that, Padmé?

189
00:10:45,588 --> 00:10:46,755
I'll be there.

190
00:10:52,672 --> 00:10:54,505
General, we just detected

191
00:10:54,588 --> 00:10:57,838
an unauthorized communication
coming from within the ship.

192
00:10:57,922 --> 00:10:59,505
What did it say?

193
00:10:59,588 --> 00:11:03,088
Well, we don't know.

194
00:11:03,171 --> 00:11:04,797
We didn't catch it in time.

195
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,004
[roars]

196
00:11:06,088 --> 00:11:09,338
Monitor all internal communications.

197
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:12,672
I want that senator on this bridge.

198
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,880
I don't see her, Anakin.

199
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:23,004
She's here, Master. I sense it.

200
00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:30,213
This is where we're supposed to meet them.

201
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:33,797
He's probably late again.

202
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,505
But we do have company of another sort.

203
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:38,213
Blast them!

204
00:11:41,171 --> 00:11:42,004
There!

205
00:11:51,213 --> 00:11:52,713
Look, Jedi.

206
00:11:52,797 --> 00:11:54,254
-Fire!
-No, wait.

207
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,088
I knew that was a bad idea.

208
00:12:00,421 --> 00:12:01,254
Jump!

209
00:12:03,254 --> 00:12:06,004
Who, me?

210
00:12:06,088 --> 00:12:07,546
[screams]

211
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,463
Padmé!

212
00:12:16,505 --> 00:12:17,380
Anakin!

213
00:12:24,463 --> 00:12:25,963
There they are.

214
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:26,922
Fire!

215
00:12:31,463 --> 00:12:32,505
The bridge is out.

216
00:12:32,588 --> 00:12:33,713
Jump to me.

217
00:12:33,797 --> 00:12:34,797
I'll use the Force.

218
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,463
You have to trust me.

219
00:12:40,505 --> 00:12:41,755
I've got you.

220
00:12:42,213 --> 00:12:43,171
[Obi-Wan] Nice catch.

221
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,088
I'll fetch the droid.

222
00:12:50,088 --> 00:12:52,213
Oh, the things you do to get me alone.

223
00:12:52,296 --> 00:12:54,129
Stop talking.

224
00:12:59,338 --> 00:13:01,254
Oh, what is going on?

225
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,254
[metal crashes]

226
00:13:09,546 --> 00:13:12,588
[screaming] Stop me, please!

227
00:13:12,672 --> 00:13:15,171
Blast, that's not good.

228
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:18,463
Anakin, I got separated from your droid.

229
00:13:18,546 --> 00:13:19,505
3PO.

230
00:13:19,588 --> 00:13:21,380
Ugh, I'll take care of it.

231
00:13:21,463 --> 00:13:22,880
We'll meet you back at the <i>Twilight.</i>

232
00:13:22,963 --> 00:13:24,380
No, we can't leave yet.

233
00:13:24,463 --> 00:13:25,880
I overheard Grievous.

234
00:13:25,963 --> 00:13:27,505
Their hyperdrive is almost repaired.

235
00:13:27,588 --> 00:13:29,546
I'm already headed in that direction,

236
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:32,880
so I'll make certain that
the hyperdrive stays offline.

237
00:13:32,963 --> 00:13:35,129
[laughs menacingly]

238
00:13:35,213 --> 00:13:39,088
We'll see about that, Jedi. Come with me.

239
00:13:39,171 --> 00:13:40,421
I'm getting you out of here.

240
00:13:40,505 --> 00:13:43,463
R2, I need you to help me find 3PO.

241
00:13:43,546 --> 00:13:44,672
He's on the rail jet.

242
00:13:44,755 --> 00:13:46,004
-[R2-D2 chirps]
-I know.

243
00:13:46,088 --> 00:13:47,505
[stuttering] I know. He does.

244
00:13:47,588 --> 00:13:50,254
Look, just find him for me,
and I'll be there soon.

245
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,463
[beeping]

246
00:13:55,922 --> 00:14:00,380
Someone stop this contraption, please!

247
00:14:00,463 --> 00:14:01,296
[metallic clicking]

248
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,380
[brakes squealing]

249
00:14:03,463 --> 00:14:04,838
[screams]

250
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:08,171
Well, I suppose I did ask for that.

251
00:14:11,421 --> 00:14:13,755
[control panels beeping]

252
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,630
[laughs maniacally]

253
00:14:30,254 --> 00:14:31,922
Hello there.

254
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,755
General Kenobi, did you really think

255
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,963
I would leave the hyperdrive unguarded?

256
00:14:44,046 --> 00:14:47,755
Anything is possible.
You haven't exactly impressed me today.

257
00:14:47,838 --> 00:14:49,296
[sinister laugh]

258
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,672
Kill him.

259
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:22,755
That was impressive.

260
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,088
[growls]

261
00:15:24,171 --> 00:15:28,672
Guard the hyperdrive!
I will deal with this Jedi myself!

262
00:15:37,797 --> 00:15:39,797
Obi-Wan? Come in, Obi-Wan.

263
00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:42,672
<i>Anakin, I'm afraid Grievous is on to us.</i>

264
00:15:42,755 --> 00:15:44,546
Yeah, we noticed.

265
00:15:46,672 --> 00:15:48,421
<i>We'll rendezvous back at the Twilight.</i>

266
00:15:48,505 --> 00:15:50,004
<i>The fleet must engage the--</i>

267
00:15:50,088 --> 00:15:51,254
-[electronic squeal]
-Obi-Wan?

268
00:15:51,338 --> 00:15:53,004
Come in. Obi-Wan!

269
00:15:53,088 --> 00:15:54,838
-What's wrong?
-They're jamming us.

270
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,505
That might buy us some time.

271
00:16:06,588 --> 00:16:08,296
I suppose you have a plan.

272
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,546
Follow me.

273
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:13,171
I do believe I'm lost...

274
00:16:13,546 --> 00:16:15,004
in enemy territory...

275
00:16:15,546 --> 00:16:16,546
and all alone.

276
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,546
[electronic chirp]

277
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,922
Don't shoot! I surrender!

278
00:16:21,046 --> 00:16:25,755
R2-D2, oh, my,
you are a sight for short circuits.

279
00:16:25,838 --> 00:16:27,213
[R2-D2 whirs]

280
00:16:27,296 --> 00:16:30,922
Master Anakin sent you to find me?
Well, what kept you then?

281
00:16:31,004 --> 00:16:33,546
[beeping]

282
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,797
The General is demanding a status report.

283
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,254
Is the hyperdrive repaired yet?

284
00:16:40,338 --> 00:16:41,713
It's almost done.

285
00:16:42,296 --> 00:16:44,880
I'll give him the good news. Uh...

286
00:16:48,588 --> 00:16:49,755
Anakin!

287
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,755
[gasps]

288
00:16:58,463 --> 00:17:01,421
Ever since I've known you,
you've been playing with droids.

289
00:17:01,505 --> 00:17:03,213
I used to put them together.

290
00:17:03,296 --> 00:17:05,672
Now I only take them apart.

291
00:17:05,755 --> 00:17:07,171
So where do we start?

292
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:10,838
First we need to get rid of these droids
so they won't know we were here.

293
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:14,713
I'm gonna hot-wire the ship,
give Grievous a little surprise.

294
00:17:15,213 --> 00:17:18,088
I guess I'll clean up the droids then.

295
00:17:21,588 --> 00:17:23,129
Our ships are in attack position.

296
00:17:23,213 --> 00:17:24,963
Any word from Master Skywalker?

297
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,546
No, the droids are jamming
our transmissions.

298
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,630
We need to give him more time.

299
00:17:30,713 --> 00:17:32,797
I'm not sure we can.

300
00:17:35,546 --> 00:17:36,463

00:17:40,588 --> 00:17:42,171

[grunts]

305
00:18:17,004 --> 00:18:19,505
That ought to do it.
How's the housecleaning going?

306
00:18:19,963 --> 00:18:21,797
Done. Let's get out of here.

307
00:18:26,838 --> 00:18:28,880
I guess repairs are finished.

308
00:18:28,963 --> 00:18:30,963
Prepare to charge up the hyperdrive.

309
00:18:31,046 --> 00:18:31,922
Roger, roger.

310
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,588
R2, are you quite certain the ship
is in this direction?

00:18:40,213 --> 00:18:41,254
[R2-D2 beeps]

312
00:18:41,338 --> 00:18:42,880
This way looks potentially dangerous.

[R2-D2 chirps]

314
00:18:44,004 --> 00:18:46,463
I know the whole place is dangerous!

315
00:18:46,922 --> 00:18:50,380
I suggest we stay here
and let Master Anakin find us.

316

[doors whoosh]

317
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,672
3PO, what are you doing?

318
00:18:52,755 --> 00:18:55,338
Don't just stand there.
Let's get back to the ship.

319
00:18:56,588 --> 00:18:57,672
Power up the engines, R2.

320
00:18:58,296 --> 00:18:59,463
Hold the ship!

321
00:19:06,046 --> 00:19:07,296
I'll contact the fleet.

322
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,296
[panel beeping]

323
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,797
R2, release the docking clamp.

[engines rumbling]

326
00:19:33,421 --> 00:19:35,004
Time for some clever tricks, Anakin.

327
00:19:35,672 --> 00:19:36,838
That's what I was thinking.

328
00:19:44,505 --> 00:19:46,505
All batteries, open fire!

329
00:19:54,713 --> 00:19:57,630
You know, we have guns.
You can shoot back any time.

-I was just about to--
-I got it.

<i>Should we retreat to friendly space?</i>

334
00:20:18,213 --> 00:20:20,338
Engage the hyperdrive.

335
00:20:20,421 --> 00:20:24,505
I'll meet you at our secret base
in Sector Four.

336
00:20:24,588 --> 00:20:27,755
You heard the General.
Prepare to make the jump to hyperspace.

337
00:20:27,838 --> 00:20:29,004
Yes, sir.

Pardon me, sir,

343
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:49,546
but R2's scan of the enemy's ship
indicates their hyperdrive is activating.

-Don't worry about it.
-What?

00:20:51,672 --> 00:20:53,254
Coordinates are locked.

<i>General, there's something</i>

Uh, the navi-computer is heading us
right into the moon!
