00:09:47,136 --> 00:09:47,970
I get a vote!

183
00:09:48,512 --> 00:09:50,011
[male Patitite] Down with democracy!

184
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:04,220
[Patitites screaming]

185
00:10:11,095 --> 00:10:11,970
[beeping]

186
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:13,970
Yes, I'm reading the gauges.

187
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,136
I have nothing to do but read gauges.

188
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,470
-[chirps]
-Why? What do the gauges say?

189
00:10:18,887 --> 00:10:21,095
-[beeps and whistles]
-Running out of power?

190
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,011
The ship and us, too?

191
00:10:23,095 --> 00:10:26,345
Oh! I knew we should never have left
the Jedi cruiser.

192
00:10:26,428 --> 00:10:27,303
[chirps excitedly]

193
00:10:27,387 --> 00:10:28,512
Another planet?

194
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:45,261
According to the positional
system coordinates,

195
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,637
this is Balnab,

196
00:10:46,929 --> 00:10:49,804
a stellar remnant
in its emerging stages

197
00:10:49,887 --> 00:10:51,095
of organic development.

198
00:10:51,178 --> 00:10:53,553
Oh! I've heard terrible stories

199
00:10:53,637 --> 00:10:54,845
about these primitive planets.

200
00:10:59,804 --> 00:11:02,178
I dare not imagine
what is beginning to swim

201
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:03,887
in their primordial soups.

202
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,929
[beeps]

203
00:11:06,178 --> 00:11:07,345
I know we have to find power,

204
00:11:07,428 --> 00:11:10,178
but do we have to find it out there?

205
00:11:12,345 --> 00:11:14,345
-[whistles and chirps]
-Afraid?

206
00:11:14,428 --> 00:11:16,720
Of course I'm not afraid.

207
00:11:17,762 --> 00:11:19,762
[squawking]

208
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,595
I am now.

209
00:11:21,887 --> 00:11:23,637
Quickly, see if your scanners

210
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,470
can find a viable power source.

211
00:11:25,553 --> 00:11:27,553
[radar whirring and beeping]

212
00:11:34,553 --> 00:11:35,512
[chitters]

213
00:11:35,637 --> 00:11:37,428
[3PO] Yes, me too.

214
00:11:37,762 --> 00:11:39,637
-[chirps]
-Life forms?

215
00:11:40,303 --> 00:11:41,136
What kind?

216
00:11:49,804 --> 00:11:51,929
They appear to be humanoid

217
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:54,011
and completely devoid of intelligence.

218
00:11:56,387 --> 00:11:57,679
[lasers blasting]

219
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,428
R2, make a dash for it!

220
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,720
[hooves thundering]

221
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:09,136
Aah!

222
00:12:12,095 --> 00:12:13,220
What are they?

223
00:12:13,637 --> 00:12:15,929
Bring them. The leader will know.

224
00:12:16,345 --> 00:12:17,553
Another leader?

225
00:12:17,637 --> 00:12:20,970
Oh! I do hope this one
is more understanding.

226
00:12:28,136 --> 00:12:29,178
[R2-D2 beeps and whirs]

227
00:12:29,261 --> 00:12:31,553
My fault? Oh! I should have known.

228
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:45,845
[booming voice]
Who dares come to my land?

229
00:12:47,261 --> 00:12:49,762
Just two wandering droids

230
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,637
searching to find their home.

231
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,720
Droids?

232
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,512
What are droids?

233
00:12:57,178 --> 00:13:00,428
Well, kind sir,
droids are mechanical beings

234
00:13:00,595 --> 00:13:02,595
possessing artificial intelligence,

235
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:04,637
-designed to make it--
-Silence!

236
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,804
At once, uh, Your Sirness.

237
00:13:07,011 --> 00:13:09,220
Being silent is one of my specialties.

238
00:13:09,303 --> 00:13:10,470
[beeps crazily]

239
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,512
Who dares to bring

240
00:13:12,595 --> 00:13:15,053
these nonliving things

241
00:13:15,136 --> 00:13:16,929
before me?

242
00:13:17,011 --> 00:13:19,261
It was I who brought them.

243
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:20,637
I thought that--

244
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,553
Aah!

245
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:24,512
[gasps] How unfortunate.

246
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:28,845
No one thinks here but me!

247
00:13:29,762 --> 00:13:30,762
[beeping urgently]

248
00:13:30,845 --> 00:13:31,720
R2, be quiet.

249
00:13:31,887 --> 00:13:33,053
This situation calls

250
00:13:33,136 --> 00:13:35,762
for my most
delicate diplomatic skills.

251
00:13:36,387 --> 00:13:40,178
Please excuse my insolent friend,
Your Eminence-ness-ness-ness.

252
00:13:40,261 --> 00:13:42,178
But I know a holographic image--

253
00:13:42,261 --> 00:13:46,470
I know not of your blasphemy!

254
00:13:54,428 --> 00:13:56,553
[3PO] <i>Perhaps "holographic"</i>
<i>is the incorrect word</i>

255
00:13:56,637 --> 00:13:57,595
<i>in your native tongue,</i>

256
00:13:57,679 --> 00:13:59,679
<i>but it is obvious</i>

257
00:13:59,762 --> 00:14:00,762
[meek voice] Not real?

258
00:14:01,261 --> 00:14:03,637
[booming voice]
I'll show you not real!

259
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,720
[electricity crackling]

260
00:14:07,762 --> 00:14:09,011
[beeps]

261
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:11,929
[meek voice]
Hey, what are you doing back here?

262
00:14:13,095 --> 00:14:14,553
[booming voice] I said,

263
00:14:14,845 --> 00:14:18,637
"What are you doing back here?"

264
00:14:19,428 --> 00:14:20,762
Back where?

265
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:22,261
[chirping]

266
00:14:22,553 --> 00:14:25,887
[meek voice] Help you?
We're not... Ahh! Ahh!

[clang]

268
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,178
We're not gonna help you.

269
00:14:30,387 --> 00:14:33,929
We worked hard to keep these
mindless organics enslaved.

270
00:14:34,095 --> 00:14:37,387
And if you want to order
someone around, get your own organics.

271
00:14:37,637 --> 00:14:39,220
[whistles and beeps]

272
00:14:39,303 --> 00:14:40,261
Oh, yeah?

273
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,845
And just how is an "astromech unit"

274
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:45,595
going to make
our loyal subjects rebel?

Uh-oh.

00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,095
Oh, my!

280
00:15:02,387 --> 00:15:03,637
Hey, get him!

281
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:06,887
Uh-oh again.

282
00:15:12,553 --> 00:15:14,929
R2, it's time to leave,

283
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,887
but we still need to recharge.

284
00:15:18,053 --> 00:15:20,345
Here they come. They're coming for us!

285
00:15:20,804 --> 00:15:22,387
We're done for!

There goes my empire!

00:15:25,595 --> 00:15:26,970
Run for it!

[groans]

290
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,261
It's all your fault, R2,
all your fault.

291
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,261
Whatever will we do now?

292
00:15:53,762 --> 00:15:55,762
R2, I'm talking to you.

293
00:15:55,845 --> 00:15:57,512
[beeping slowly]

294
00:15:57,595 --> 00:15:58,804
Please don't mumble.

[beeping slowly]

296
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:05,428
R2, you're almost out of power.

297
00:16:06,011 --> 00:16:07,053
Here, rest.

299
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,303
Me?

300
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:15,595
I have 1.723% left in my power core.

301
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,553
I thought for sure

302
00:16:17,637 --> 00:16:19,345
you would have figured
something out by now.

303
00:16:20,053 --> 00:16:22,136
You're usually so good
at that sort of thing.

Oh, R2, don't leave me,

please.

308
00:16:31,553 --> 00:16:32,970
Rest, my friend.

309
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:37,470

I will be joining you soon.

[pirate 1] That Republic Y-wing
is a great prize.

00:17:03,345 --> 00:17:05,929
[pirate 2] Do you think there are
any Jedi around?

312
00:17:06,136 --> 00:17:08,428
[pirate 1] Don't worry.
We'll be taking off

313
00:17:08,512 --> 00:17:10,929
before anyone realizes we've landed.

314
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,011
What have we here?

315
00:17:13,512 --> 00:17:16,553
Looks like two droids
that ran out of power.

316
00:17:16,637 --> 00:17:18,887

00:17:28,428 --> 00:17:29,970
This should be a fun one.

324
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:40,595
...would rescue us.

325
00:17:41,345 --> 00:17:43,178
Master Anakin?

326
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:47,470
R2! You're... you're recharged!

327
00:17:48,053 --> 00:17:49,220
I'm recharged.

328
00:17:49,762 --> 00:17:50,845
We survived.

329
00:17:51,428 --> 00:17:52,303
Where are we?

330
00:17:52,387 --> 00:17:53,804
[chirps]

331
00:17:53,887 --> 00:17:55,011
Pirates?

[chuckles, humming]

333
00:17:58,178 --> 00:17:59,095
Oh, my.

[all shouting]

335
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,136
What are they cheering for?

336
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,011
[robotic voice] Ahh.

337
00:18:18,178 --> 00:18:19,053
Ahh!

Soon it will be us.

[grumbling triumphantly]

341
00:18:36,136 --> 00:18:37,220
Oh, my stars!

342
00:18:39,261 --> 00:18:40,887
Oh, no. Whoa!

343
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,929
General, we've come across

344
00:18:47,011 --> 00:18:48,804
what appears to be a pirate ship.

345
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:52,303
Use that ship for target practice.

346
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,053
Open fire!

347
00:18:54,637 --> 00:18:56,512
All forward cannons, open fire!

348
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:57,845
Battle stations!

[3PO] Oh, my! Oh, oh!

351
00:19:06,387 --> 00:19:07,887
Go get him, R2!

Oh, no!

355
00:19:26,303 --> 00:19:28,178
We'll never get back to the ship!

356
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:40,762
We surrender.

357
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:42,303
We surrender!

358
00:19:42,887 --> 00:19:44,762
Uh, where did you come from?

359
00:19:45,303 --> 00:19:46,762
They must be pirate droids.

360
00:19:47,095 --> 00:19:48,387
Pirate droids?

361
00:19:48,762 --> 00:19:49,804
You're under arrest.

362
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,136
Pirate droids?
We're not pirate droids.

363
00:19:52,303 --> 00:19:53,762
-We are part of the Republic--
-[beeps]

364
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:57,011
Oh, yes, uh, we are pirate droids.

365
