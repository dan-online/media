1
00:00:07,767 --> 00:00:10,000
(Theme Song playing)

2
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,767
CLARKSON: Hello!

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,333
Hello, good evening,
and welcome!

4
00:00:28,367 --> 00:00:31,033
Thank you so much.

5
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:34,533
Now, this is a
mobile telephone.

6
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:37,200
It's fully functional,
and what I'm going to do...

7
00:00:37,233 --> 00:00:40,500
-(Splashing)
...Is throw it
in that lavatory.

8
00:00:40,533 --> 00:00:43,700
I know that's the first time
you've ever seen a programme
start that way,

9
00:00:43,733 --> 00:00:47,267
but bear with me,
because if we now look...

10
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:50,733
Yeah, it's only been
in the water
for a few seconds,

11
00:00:50,767 --> 00:00:52,333
but it's ruined forever.

12
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:54,300
If you wanted
to communicate with somebody,

13
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:57,200
you'd be better off
using a Brussels sprout.

14
00:00:57,233 --> 00:00:59,500
Yeah, but, of course, because
if you expose your phone

15
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:03,867
to any form of moisture
or heat or dust or vibration,

16
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,067
it will break.

17
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,800
It's not just phones,
it's everything.

18
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:09,067
Printers, laptops,
wi-fi routers...

19
00:01:09,067 --> 00:01:12,933
My coffee machine breaks
even when you
expose it to coffee.

20
00:01:12,967 --> 00:01:17,833
Anything with a circuit board
is as reliable as
a Greek accountant.

21
00:01:18,767 --> 00:01:22,533
It is! Except, weirdly,
except cars.

22
00:01:22,567 --> 00:01:25,900
Now, we were
talking about this
in the office the other day,

23
00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:27,833
and there was
a bit of an argument.

24
00:01:27,867 --> 00:01:31,767
We were saying you can
drive a car across the Sahara,
the arctic,

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,533
you can run it through
hurricanes and dust storms,
and it'll be fine.

26
00:01:35,567 --> 00:01:38,867
Mmm, but the producers
are saying that
because modern cars

27
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,433
are so complex
and so electronical,

28
00:01:41,467 --> 00:01:45,067
they're bound to suffer
from reliability problems
like everything else.

29
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,567
Right. So, to see
who is correct,
the producers said to us,

30
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,833
"go out and each choose
your favourite modern GT car,

31
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:55,367
"and then report with them
to what's billed as,

32
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,500
"'the most hirsute and manly
proving ground of them all,'"

33
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:01,900
Austria.

34
00:02:01,933 --> 00:02:03,600
No, James, Australia.

35
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:06,467
Same thing.

36
00:02:14,733 --> 00:02:19,433
CLARKSON:  This is
the hirsute and manly
proving ground in question.

37
00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:26,167
The vast,
almost completely uninhabited
northern territory,

38
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:29,900
better known as the outback.

39
00:02:37,967 --> 00:02:41,900
Richard had chosen
to take on this brutal and
enormous wilderness

40
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:46,533
in a car that was
designed for the car park
at Old Trafford,

41
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:48,833
a Bentley Continental GT.

42
00:02:51,433 --> 00:02:53,100
James had gone for a car

43
00:02:53,133 --> 00:02:56,733
engineered for the
velvet smoothness of
the world's racetracks,

44
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:58,900
a Nissan GT-R.

45
00:03:01,967 --> 00:03:06,300
And I was in
the ultimate Monaco-to-Munich
mile-muncher,

46
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:09,200
the BMW M6 Gran Coupe.

47
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:20,567
CLARKSON: Tell you what...
HAMMOND: What?

48
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,800
I think this is the first time
in all of  Top Gear's history

49
00:03:23,833 --> 00:03:27,333
where all three of us
like all three of the cars.

50
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:29,533
I mean, normally
I'd get out and go,
"yours is rubbish,

51
00:03:29,567 --> 00:03:30,800
"and you've made
the wrong decision

52
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,467
"and I'm the only one
who's done it properly."

53
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,167
Yeah, that's a
good point actually
'cause I do like your car,

54
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,333
and I do like your car,
Hammond, and I like
my car obviously.

55
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:38,200
-That's a GT-R.
You can't not like a GT-R.
-Yeah.

56
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:42,133
If you like driving
above all else

57
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:44,500
and to the exclusion
of all other considerations,

58
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:46,100
you have to have one of these.

59
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,367
If you have a Ferrari
or a Lamborghini

60
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,067
what you're saying is,
"I'm not that interested
in driving."

61
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,367
-It's showing off.
-It's showing off.

62
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,133
Speaking of which,
the Bentley Continental.
Now what happened there?

63
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:04,533
MAY:  We used to think
it was a bit dull and now
it's, sort of, good.

64
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:05,867
-But it was overnight!
-It was.

65
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,067
We all must have woken up
independently...

66
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:08,100
I hate the
Bentley Continental.

67
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:09,200
I hate the
Bentley Continental.

68
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:10,500
I hate the
Bentley Continental.

69
00:04:10,533 --> 00:04:12,367
God, I love the
Bentley Continental.

70
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,667
I don't understand that.

71
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,267
'Cause they haven't
changed the styling much.

72
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,133
No, not since... I mean,
it's been around a while now.

73
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:19,833
But then we just woke up
one morning and went,
"that looks really good!"

74
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:22,600
MAY: I'd actually
have a yellow one as well.
I think it looks tremendous!

75
00:04:22,633 --> 00:04:25,567
But then, while we're on
the subject of styling...
Hmm-mmm-mmm!

76
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:30,933
Oh, how we mocked
when they said that
they were gonna do this.

77
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:32,833
Right, so you're gonna
do a four-door version

78
00:04:32,867 --> 00:04:35,233
of a two-door version
of a four-door saloon car.

79
00:04:35,267 --> 00:04:37,767
And then it came out,
and you just thought,
"that is so good-looking."

80
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,067
I love that back wheel.
That dished back wheel
in there looks sick!

81
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,067
-It's fantastic, isn't it?
-And then...

82
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:45,800
Almost a double bubble roof.
I know it's carbon fibre
which is a little bit...

83
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,467
MAY: You know,
we can gloss over that, yes.

84
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,333
CLARKSON:
But, God, it looks good.

85
00:04:49,367 --> 00:04:53,800
As we continued our three-car
love-in, a challenge arrived.

86
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,400
Here we go.

87
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:59,333
"You will drive to a farm
which is four days from here."

88
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,733
Everything's four days
from everything in Australia.

89
00:05:02,767 --> 00:05:07,600
"And when you arrive
you will use your cars
to round up 4,000 cows."

90
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,067
-Wha...
-Can you do that?

91
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:13,267
The farm is a big one.
Three million acres!

92
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,200
-No, it's not three million.
-You read that wrong.

93
00:05:15,233 --> 00:05:16,600
(Chuckling)

94
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:18,233
Three... It's not...
Are you sure you...

95
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:19,600
Is it 300,000?

96
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:21,133
-Three million is it?
-That's a big farm!

97
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:25,767
Never mind that. Rounding up
4,000 cows using...

98
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,367
-These.
-(Gasps)

99
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:30,100
Oh God, James
what have you done?

100
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,833
-What's he done?
-What?

101
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:36,867
As we know, there is a strong
republican movement
in this country.

102
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,700
People who think
it's ridiculous to have
a head of state

103
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:41,400
living in London, on the
other side of the world.

104
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:44,967
He turns up here with that
on the number plate.

105
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:46,200
What?

106
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:48,233
CLARKSON:
Can you not see that?
It's obvious.

107
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:51,800
-No.
-Charles and Camilla.

108
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,367
You've done it on purpose,
haven't you James?

109
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,933
-Look, let me explain.
-Hammond: You
blithering idiot!

110
00:05:54,967 --> 00:05:57,133
CLARKSON: You idiot!
HAMMOND: Oh no!

111
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:59,500
Mine says "big royalist."

112
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:00,900
CLARKSON: It does!
Big royalist!

113
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:02,700
HAMMOND: It totally does,
and you can see it.

114
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:05,433
Luckily, mine just
says "BMW 001"

115
00:06:05,467 --> 00:06:07,433
'Cause I've covered
myself on this occasion.

116
00:06:08,267 --> 00:06:09,633
No, you idiot.

117
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:11,333
"Bloody Mrs Windsor."

118
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:14,067
-Oh no! Bloody Mrs Windsor!
-Oh no!
We're in a lot of trouble.

119
00:06:14,067 --> 00:06:17,567
How could he possibly know?
I rang them up and said,
"can you provide a car?

120
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,500
"Can you make sure
the number plate doesn't say
'convict' or anything on it,"

121
00:06:21,533 --> 00:06:22,900
And they've done that!

122
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:24,100
We're gonna have
to drive through...

123
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,500
We'll be stoned
by republicans.

124
00:06:29,467 --> 00:06:33,267
CLARKSON:  As we set off,
though, we had
a more immediate problem.

125
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:40,200
Could our complicated cars
really cope with this vast,
super-heated dust bowl?

126
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,767
Vauxhall once thought
they'd try and sell
the senator in Australia,

127
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,133
a big old saloon made
in Germany in the '80s.

128
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:54,600
So they shipped one out here,
and it lasted a couple of days

129
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:56,733
and then it split in half.

130
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,967
Split in half!

131
00:06:58,067 --> 00:07:01,133
That's how brutal
the outback is.

132
00:07:02,767 --> 00:07:08,067
This car has
electronic valve control,
electronic gearbox control,

133
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:11,500
an electronic differential,
everything is electronic.

134
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:16,233
It actually has
a sensor in the engine
that adjusts all the settings

135
00:07:16,267 --> 00:07:18,200
so that no matter how
hot it is or how cold it is

136
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:21,933
you always get 575 horsepower.

137
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:25,200
And I'm expecting it
to work here, in this dust,

138
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:27,900
and this heat,
and with these vibrations,

139
00:07:27,933 --> 00:07:29,600
and then go farming.

140
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:36,467
MAY: My Nissan
is an absolute nerdfest.

141
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,867
I'm gonna give you
a few examples.

142
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,933
It's built in a
hermetically-sealed factory

143
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:43,700
so that no dust can get into
the engine or the gearbox.

144
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:46,367
The tyres are filled
with nitrogen,

145
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,367
'cause it's more stable
than atmospheric air.

146
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,267
The engine is canted slightly
forwards under the bonnet,

147
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,433
so when it tenses up
under acceleration

148
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:57,833
it all forms a nice,
straight, efficient line.

149
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:05,800
I mean, it's been built by the
cream of Japanese automotive
engineers at Nissan.

150
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,167
That's a pretty
good guarantee.

151
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,800
But even they, watching this,
would think,

152
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,067
"are we sure?"

153
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:21,633
HAMMOND:  This has
30 ecus in it.

154
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,467
That's 30 laptops
buzzing away all over.

155
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,767
It's got two miles
of wiring in it,

156
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,400
a lot of which is super-fast,
super-sophisticated,
super delicate fibre optics.

157
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:33,833
And this dust is
going to get everywhere.

158
00:08:33,867 --> 00:08:38,067
And delicate, modern,
sophisticated electronics
do not like dust.

159
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,067
CLARKSON:  As Hammond
was rabbiting on about dust,

160
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,700
I decided to have
a debate with James

161
00:08:48,733 --> 00:08:51,467
about which of our cars
was the fastest.

162
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:57,133
You know, the Datsun
you're driving is
unbelievably fast, yes?

163
00:08:57,733 --> 00:08:59,333
MAY:  Yes.

164
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:03,533
Off the line,
this will leave it for dead.

165
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:06,633
The M6 will cream you!

166
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:09,833
No, not off the line it won't.
You know that's nonsense.

167
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,933
CLARKSON:  To prove him wrong,
I decided to have a drag race

168
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:20,267
on one of the many
world war ii airfields

169
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,633
that litter this part
of northern Australia.

170
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:27,300
It is absolutely blistering,
this thing!

171
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,300
0 to 60, 2.8 seconds!

172
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,767
2.8!

173
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,800
Hammond, would you like to
come in to amuse us with your
stately home in a drag race?

174
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:39,967
Yes. All right, if I must.

175
00:09:40,067 --> 00:09:44,233
He's probably got a demented
relation living in a tower
in there somewhere.

176
00:09:50,367 --> 00:09:53,600
HAMMOND:  It didn't take long
to find an airfield.

177
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:58,233
And we lined up on the runway,
with me resigned to my fate.

178
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,433
I have a 4-litre,
twin turbo v8,

179
00:10:03,467 --> 00:10:06,233
making 521 brake horsepower.

180
00:10:06,267 --> 00:10:09,433
But I think
I may struggle here.

181
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:13,900
They've got launch control,
more power
and they're lighter.

182
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:17,100
It's come up here,
what I have to do to engage
the launch control.

183
00:10:17,133 --> 00:10:20,567
So, "deactivate
dynamic stability control.

184
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,167
"Select sequential mode with
drive programme three."

185
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,300
That sharps up
the gear changes.

186
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:29,667
"With the engine running,
depress the brake
with the left foot."

187
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,067
Done that.

188
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,500
"Push the selector lever
forwards and hold.

189
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,433
"A flag symbol appears
in the instrument cluster."

190
00:10:39,433 --> 00:10:40,467
It doesn't.

191
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:42,867
Start again. Into f...

192
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,467
-(Beeping)
-Oh...

193
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,733
It will be
a fairly simple process,
but it will be beyond

194
00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:51,833
the mind of the average ape.

195
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:53,867
Maybe the air-conditioning
has to be off.

196
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,533
(Button Clicking)

197
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:57,067
Let's try that. Nope.

198
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:00,167
MAY:  Things were
much simpler in the Nissan.

199
00:11:00,733 --> 00:11:02,833
Right. On, on, on.

200
00:11:02,867 --> 00:11:04,733
Red, red, red.

201
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:07,200
Manual mode first,
left foot on the brake.

202
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,633
This is a tiresome formality.
I'm sorry to waste
your time, viewers.

203
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:14,500
Nothing in the world moves
off the line more quickly
than a Nissan GT-R.

204
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:15,967
That's just
one of those facts.

205
00:11:16,067 --> 00:11:18,100
It's probably
in the bible somewhere.

206
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:20,900
Right, not a lot to do in
the Bentley before we do this.

207
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:23,300
Lower the ride height. Done.

208
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:27,500
Firm up the suspension.
Let's have that on "sport."

209
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:29,167
And that's it.
I'm ready to go.

210
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,833
HAMMOND:  And after
about half an hour,
so was Jeremy.

211
00:11:33,867 --> 00:11:35,400
Okay, we're good to go.
We're good to go.

212
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:38,600
Three... Two... One.

213
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:41,567
(Engines Roaring)

214
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:47,533
CLARKSON: Oh, it's gone.
It's gone, it's gone,
it's gone.

215
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:51,300
Bmw, scrabbling about
for traction,
all over the shop.

216
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,500
Should prove the point.

217
00:11:56,867 --> 00:11:58,067
HAMMOND: Wow!

218
00:11:58,067 --> 00:11:59,167
(Laughing)

219
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:04,267
This launch control
doesn't work.

220
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,467
(Chuckling)

221
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,467
It does about
five feet and it goes,
"oh, I can't be bothered."

222
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,700
As, it seems, had James.

223
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,933
CLARKSON: Why did you stop?

224
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:17,433
I won.

225
00:12:17,467 --> 00:12:19,067
What do you mean, you won?
The flags are down there!

226
00:12:19,067 --> 00:12:21,467
No, you said, "which is
the quickest off the mark?"

227
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,867
-Mine was.
-No, you weren't.

228
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,167
-It was!
-It wasn't.

229
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,633
It went like a scalded rabbit!

230
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:27,533
I know, but I was off
the mark quicker.

231
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:29,733
-You weren't!
-Nothing is quicker off
the mark than this car.

232
00:12:29,767 --> 00:12:32,067
-Do... Do you want
to check the camera?
-Yes.

233
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:33,067
Well, then, we'll go
check the camera.

234
00:12:33,067 --> 00:12:35,100
We'll go and
check the camera.

235
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:37,067
CLARKSON:  We went
to check the camera.

236
00:12:37,667 --> 00:12:39,067
You watch this, okay?

237
00:12:39,867 --> 00:12:42,300
-Right, and go!
MAY: Go!

238
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,500
CLARKSON: God! We haven't got
very good reactions, have we?

239
00:12:44,533 --> 00:12:46,067
HAMMOND: Oh my God!
We are useless.

240
00:12:46,067 --> 00:12:47,800
CLARKSON: No, that can't...

241
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,433
MAY: Yes!
Thank you! Thank you!
HAMMOND: Yeah, you were first.

242
00:12:50,467 --> 00:12:51,967
-CLARKSON: What?
-(May laughing)

243
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:54,200
CLARKSON:
Oh God, look, the BMW is...
Why am I last?

244
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:57,600
Right. We've established...
I think the Nissan
just wins it...

245
00:12:57,633 --> 00:12:59,500
-(Clearing throat)
-...Over 16 meters,

246
00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:02,900
followed by the Bentley,
BMW, a rather poor third.

247
00:13:02,933 --> 00:13:04,833
HAMMOND: Yes.

248
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:08,200
CLARKSON:  I therefore
decided we should
have another drag race

249
00:13:08,233 --> 00:13:13,200
in which James would
go all the way,
and I'd go old-school.

250
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:15,200
CLARKSON: I'm doing
manual gear changes,

251
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:18,600
manual start,
no traction control.

252
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:20,200
Me and the machine.

253
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,467
This is a serious test,
actually, of these cars,

254
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,333
drag racing them in this heat.

255
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,667
107 degrees Fahrenheit.

256
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,233
HAMMOND: Three... Two... One.

257
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:38,333
Come on, Bentley!
Come on! Come on!

258
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:43,267
I am hard on the heels
of the Nissan.

259
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:47,167
Oh, my God!
I'm overtaking it!

260
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,867
Come on, Beemer!

261
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:54,867
I've got the Datsun!

262
00:13:59,267 --> 00:14:02,267
That Bentley is
unbelievably fast.

263
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:05,533
But I'm gonna get him.

264
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,967
(Laughing) Oh, this is
the closest I've ever seen!

265
00:14:14,133 --> 00:14:17,900
Come on, Beemer! You can't
lose to that monster!

266
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:21,167
No way! No way!

267
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,400
(Hammond Laughing)

268
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,700
Yes!

269
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:29,133
What a machine you are, BMW!

270
00:14:33,067 --> 00:14:37,067
CLARKSON:  Having established
that the most powerful car
is the fastest,

271
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:39,167
we got back on the road.

272
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,867
Cooling down now
in the evening,

273
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,300
it's down to
98 degrees Fahrenheit.

274
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:50,133
The producers said
we'd be staying that night
at the million stars motel

275
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:54,267
which boasted the finest fish
restaurant in the outback.

276
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,067
And we were looking
forward to that.

277
00:14:57,067 --> 00:15:00,933
However, when they
told us we'd arrived...

278
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:06,167
-Hammond: Where is it?
-(Sighing)

279
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,300
-I know exactly what this is.
-I've got it.

280
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,667
What?

281
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,067
-"Million star motel."
-Yup.

282
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,900
-Oh.
-Best fish restaurant
in the outback.

283
00:15:13,933 --> 00:15:15,133
-It's a joke.
-Stars.

284
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:18,100
MAY: Yes. It's a funny joke.

285
00:15:18,133 --> 00:15:20,067
-Funny.
-Funny. Yeah, good.

286
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:23,100
So, we're tenting.

287
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,400
MAY:  We were given
some horrible camping stuff,

288
00:15:27,433 --> 00:15:30,167
and an Australian kitchen.

289
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,567
And once that had been set up,
we had to catch our supper.

290
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:36,600
-May...
-Thanks.

291
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:38,067
-Welcome to  top gear.
-(Sighing)

292
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,700
Oh, fucking hell.

293
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:45,133
(Both Chuckling)

294
00:15:46,433 --> 00:15:47,600
What're you struggling with?

295
00:15:47,633 --> 00:15:49,933
-Every single...
-No! Watch it!

296
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:51,567
Can you look behind you
when you do that?

297
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,933
CLARKSON: Yes!
Why are you in your car?

298
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:58,967
I am in the car because the
crocodiles are in that pond.

299
00:15:59,067 --> 00:16:01,533
CLARKSON: Oh, there're
no crocodiles here.

300
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:03,100
HAMMOND: Well, there are!

301
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:07,133
They can sit underwater.
These are machines
for killing and eating!

302
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,867
They can tackle
a water buffalo whole!

303
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,233
Are you not scared
of crocodiles?

304
00:16:11,267 --> 00:16:13,067
Well, I'm not
when they're not there.

305
00:16:13,067 --> 00:16:14,600
-Hammond: then there's
the snakes.
-(Clarkson groaning)

306
00:16:14,633 --> 00:16:16,433
HAMMOND: There's the
death adders!

307
00:16:16,467 --> 00:16:19,900
There is no country on earth
where the public perception
of the country

308
00:16:19,933 --> 00:16:23,133
is further removed from
the reality than Australia.

309
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:25,600
-But it's just tourist...
-(Water splashing)

310
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:28,133
Hold on, what was that?
What did that?

311
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:29,567
MAY: Well, it's gone
under the water.

312
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,233
-Where's he gone?
-I don't know,
but he's gone down.

313
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,667
-Oh, look at that!
-It is!

314
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,967
Yes, it is.

315
00:16:37,067 --> 00:16:38,867
CLARKSON: That is moving
towards us, isn't it?

316
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,467
HAMMOND: Yes!

317
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,133
Did you read last week
about the one that ate
a Bentley whole?

318
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:45,733
-Complete with the man in it.
-Yeah, but it spat
the Bentley out.

319
00:16:45,767 --> 00:16:47,967
It carries a spare
set of teeth.

320
00:16:48,067 --> 00:16:49,600
-Does it?
-Yes.

321
00:16:52,267 --> 00:16:54,833
CLARKSON: Thank you very much.
Thank you.

322
00:16:54,867 --> 00:16:57,800
Now, because we're in
Australia this week,

323
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:02,433
and because Australia is
enormous and full of
a million things to do,

324
00:17:02,467 --> 00:17:05,500
we have no time
to do the news,
I'm afraid.

325
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:09,233
Nor do we have time
for the Stig to go
around the track,

326
00:17:09,267 --> 00:17:14,133
but we have made time
to put a star in our
reasonably-priced car,

327
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:16,067
and that's because
my guest tonight

328
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:21,733
is the best British actor
ever to come out of Canada.

329
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:26,233
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome, from America,
Kiefer Sutherland!

330
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:30,667
Oh, hi, how are you?

331
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,633
That's something else.

332
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:32,733
-Good to see you.
-How are you?

333
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:35,700
-Hi! Great!
-Look who's here!

334
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:37,300
-Thank you.
-Jack Bauer!

335
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:41,067
Thank you very much.
How are you?

336
00:17:41,067 --> 00:17:43,067
-I'm very well.
How are you?
-Good.

337
00:17:43,067 --> 00:17:45,067
I think a lot of people
would be surprised to find

338
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:47,133
that you were actually
born in London, weren't you?

339
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:49,333
Yeah.
I was born in Paddington.

340
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:51,400
In fact, there was a
very funny moment,

341
00:17:51,433 --> 00:17:54,667
I was doing a documentary
with a friend, and he was
following me with a camera,

342
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,133
and I said, "Oh, St Mary's
hospital is right down here.
That's where I was born,"

343
00:17:58,167 --> 00:18:02,067
And as I was showing it
to him, a wrecking ball
came out of nowhere

344
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:03,433
and just knocked it down,

345
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:05,200
and apparently they were
moving it across the street,

346
00:18:05,233 --> 00:18:09,067
so I got the last vision
of the hospital
that I was born in.

347
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:10,867
The place of your birth,
they'd knocked it down?

348
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,567
-Yeah.
-Yeah, I know,
they did that with mine,

349
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,233
while I was being born.
Um...

350
00:18:15,267 --> 00:18:17,333
-Of course, your father,
he's Donald.
-Yes!

351
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:19,867
I want to get on to this.
It's slightly delicate, but...

352
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,300
Nobody likes to think
of their parents having sex.

353
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,667
-Mmm-hmm.
-This is not something
we can even visualise.

354
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,633
-But your father, of course,
was in  Don't Look Now.
-Yes.

355
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:29,567
-With Julie Christie.
-Yes.

356
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,733
Is that a struggle
for you to watch?

357
00:18:32,767 --> 00:18:37,133
It was a real struggle
at about 13, 14, because
Julie Christie was stunning,

358
00:18:37,167 --> 00:18:39,267
and you're 14 years old,
and you're watching it,

359
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,100
and you're trying to
block your father out.

360
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:45,167
And then, "no,
this isn't gonna work,
this isn't gonna work."

361
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,367
But yes, that moment
was kind of tricky.

362
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,333
Now, obviously,
you're best known for  24,

363
00:18:53,367 --> 00:18:55,933
and I know a lot
of people here will
want me to talk about  24.

364
00:18:55,967 --> 00:18:57,933
-Sure.
-Now, I think I'm
right in saying,

365
00:18:57,967 --> 00:19:01,467
was it the first of the,
sort of, what we now take as
the binge-viewing box set?

366
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,367
-Yes.
-It sort of was.
There'd before...

367
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,833
And there'd never been,
like, you were
a big-name actor,

368
00:19:05,867 --> 00:19:08,667
-who took up a TV role,
which now is the norm.
-Mmm-hmm. Right.

369
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,933
I mean, you've got
kevin spacey going in
house of cards and so on,

370
00:19:11,967 --> 00:19:16,067
but back then,
you were either a TV actor
or you were a movie actor.

371
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:18,233
And so it was
a groundbreaking thing.

372
00:19:18,267 --> 00:19:21,067
Well, for me it was
a no-brainer.

373
00:19:21,067 --> 00:19:23,600
I noticed that
the film world was changing.

374
00:19:23,633 --> 00:19:26,800
We used to have five studios
that made 50-some-odd
movies a year.

375
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:30,067
Went down to three studios
that were making
15 movies a year.

376
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:31,533
And all of a sudden,
the movies that I liked,

377
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:34,067
like  ordinary people,
or  terms of endearment,

378
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,067
their kind of
$20 million movie
wasn't getting made any more.

379
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,833
It was all superheroes,

380
00:19:38,867 --> 00:19:42,067
and all of the great drama
was kind of shifting over
to television.

381
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:43,833
And with regards
to the binge-watching,

382
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:47,133
I ran into a gentleman
at an airport

383
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:49,267
and he said,
"you ruined my honeymoon."

384
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,100
And I said, "how?"

385
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:52,800
And he said, "well,
my wife..." I said,
"I don't even know your wife."

386
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:57,333
And he said,
"no, no, no,
not that, not that.

387
00:19:57,367 --> 00:20:01,100
"We watched the first 12 hours
of  24 on the plane
from Los Angeles to Paris,

388
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,167
"and the first day
of our honeymoon,

389
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,000
"we spent the next
12 hours in the hotel,
watching the next 12 hours."

390
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:09,533
I went, "well..."
And I was flattered by that.

391
00:20:09,567 --> 00:20:10,867
Yeah, ruining people's...

392
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,800
24 actually ruined
my children's lives,

393
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:15,000
because they were young
when it first started,

394
00:20:15,033 --> 00:20:18,533
9:00 was their bedtime,
but they had to go
immediately at 9:00,

395
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:22,200
and even now, when they
hear the word "previously..."
They go to bed.

396
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:24,667
"Uh-oh, we go to bed."

397
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,233
That's quite a great tool.

398
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:29,033
But it was very
important in my life.
Very, very important.

399
00:20:29,067 --> 00:20:30,867
Wow. Thank you very much.

400
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,833
CLARKSON: No, I'm sure
a lot of people here
would agree with me on that.

401
00:20:32,867 --> 00:20:36,033
-Didn't you do rodeo riding?
-I did, yeah. Yeah.

402
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:37,833
Actually professionally,
or just...

403
00:20:37,867 --> 00:20:39,533
I roped in the USTRC circuit,

404
00:20:39,567 --> 00:20:43,300
and I was fortunate enough,
I think, I won
about three or four.

405
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,267
So why don't you do more
movies that call for you to
ride around on horses?

406
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,867
They don't make a lot of them.
I'm actually one of
the few actors I know

407
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,033
that's actually gotten
to do a western.

408
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:53,900
Earlier in my career,
I got to do films

409
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:55,467
like  young guns I
and  young guns ii,
and I wish they made more.

410
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,667
Can't Charlie Sheen
ride a horse? He must be
able to ride, no?

411
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,600
Charlie Sheen
didn't like horses,
and horses didn't like him,

412
00:21:01,633 --> 00:21:04,733
and that was firmly
established when we were
shooting  young guns I,

413
00:21:04,767 --> 00:21:08,400
and most of the scenes
involving Charlie on a horse,
he was on a ladder,

414
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,467
with a saddle,
and some poor teamster
holding the bit,

415
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,467
and he would hold the reins
and he would kind of
act his way out of that,

416
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,300
and when we went to
go do  Three Musketeers,

417
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,467
I remember saying to the
AD, Lee Cleary,

418
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,167
"what are you
shooting right now?"
And he said,

419
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,300
"oh, we've got Charlie
coming around the bend
on a horse."

420
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:26,533
I said, "you do, do you?
Oh, that's pretty great.

421
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:28,433
"I'd get your people
out of the road."

422
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:30,833
And he said, "no, no, no,
he's gonna stop right by
the camera over there."

423
00:21:30,867 --> 00:21:33,067
I said, "I promise you,
he's not."

424
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:36,567
And they called "action,"
And you could hear the horse,

425
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,167
starts off in
a kind of a trot,

426
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,633
and then in seconds
you could hear
it's in a full gallop,

427
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:45,700
then off in the distance
you hear, "whoa! Fuck, whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Fuck, whoa!"

428
00:21:45,733 --> 00:21:48,967
And then he came
around the corner, and
he's holding on to the mane.

429
00:21:49,067 --> 00:21:51,400
He's let go of the reins.

430
00:21:51,433 --> 00:21:55,533
He's now holding on
for dear life, and he's
hitting the horse,

431
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:57,233
in the back,
behind the ear.

432
00:21:57,267 --> 00:22:00,067
And I remember
Lee Cleary, he went,

433
00:22:00,067 --> 00:22:01,700
"well, you weren't
fucking joking there,
were you?"

434
00:22:01,733 --> 00:22:05,833
And he didn't move.
Didn't move a muscle
to help him, you know?

435
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:07,767
Um, now, we're gonna
move on to your cars,

436
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,867
'cause I've looked at
your car history,
which is pretty good.

437
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,400
-Thanks!
-'Cause you began
with a '67 Mustang.

438
00:22:12,433 --> 00:22:16,833
I did, yes.
When I was about 17 years old,
I was living in New York,

439
00:22:16,867 --> 00:22:21,867
and I wanted to get
to Los Angeles, and I did
a print ad for Levi's,

440
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,733
and I took that money
and I bought a '67 Mustang,
six-cylinder,

441
00:22:25,767 --> 00:22:30,800
and I learnt how to drive
somewhere between
New York and Maryland,

442
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:36,733
and then got pretty good at it
somewhere around
the Texas panhandle.

443
00:22:36,767 --> 00:22:38,767
-You've got
a Panamera now, too?
-I do, yeah.

444
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,733
What in the name of all
that's holy possessed you to
buy a Panamera,

445
00:22:43,767 --> 00:22:45,633
which is not
a good-looking car.

446
00:22:45,667 --> 00:22:48,867
It was... I think it's one of
the most beautiful interiors
I've ever seen.

447
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,333
I like those buttons
in a herringbone.
That's brilliant.

448
00:22:51,367 --> 00:22:53,167
I think it's phenomenal.

449
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,067
But I was actually
going to shoot  24
in cape town, in South Africa.

450
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,533
And the flight I had
was from Los Angeles
to frankfurt,

451
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:01,667
and then Frankfurt
to South Africa.

452
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,900
And Porsche, before
Panamera had come out,

453
00:23:03,933 --> 00:23:07,900
they would take you off
the plane, they would take
your luggage off the plane,

454
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:09,367
they would put it
in a Panamera,

455
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,833
the Panamera was
being driven by
a race car driver,

456
00:23:11,867 --> 00:23:16,067
and they would take you
to the next terminal, which
was about five miles away.

457
00:23:16,067 --> 00:23:18,733
And he would get it
up to about 145 miles an hour,

458
00:23:18,767 --> 00:23:24,200
and halfway to the terminal,
you're like, "holy shit, I've
gotta get me one of these!"

459
00:23:24,233 --> 00:23:26,900
Anyway, the lap.
How was it out there?

460
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:32,733
Well, first of all, you know,
it's an amazing experience,
I have to say.

461
00:23:32,767 --> 00:23:34,267
I've been watching
this show for years.

462
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,667
I've been making fun of people
driving this car all the time,

463
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,700
and the whole time
while the Stig was driving,
I'm like,

464
00:23:39,733 --> 00:23:42,933
"oh, I wish I'd never
made fun of anybody
driving this car."

465
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,433
It scared the crap out of me.

466
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:47,500
He got it going at
such a point
where I'm like,

467
00:23:47,533 --> 00:23:49,500
"you're not gonna make it!
You're not gonna make it!"

468
00:23:49,533 --> 00:23:53,267
Literally, I felt like that
sticker of Garfield
at the back of the car,

469
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,100
trying to crawl out.

470
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:57,200
That'll be the follow-through.
We'll go through the tyres.

471
00:23:57,233 --> 00:24:00,600
So, who would like
to see the lap?

472
00:24:00,633 --> 00:24:02,500
AUDIENCE: Yes!

473
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:03,733
Can I say,
can I introduce this?

474
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:05,267
Yes.

475
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,933
The following events
take place in real time.

476
00:24:07,967 --> 00:24:10,167
I've always wanted to do that!
Here we go. Let's play it.

477
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,567
SUTHERLAND:
I like the colour.

478
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,167
CLARKSON:  Yeah, the colour
stands out well.

479
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,633
You see, this is
unusual weather
for Britain in January.

480
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:19,067
This is that moment
where you think of
nothing to say.

481
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,433
Except,  "scheisse."

482
00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:24,333
CLARKSON:  You should've
said, "damn it!"

483
00:24:24,367 --> 00:24:26,167
SUTHERLAND:  Damn it!
CLARKSON:  We would have liked
a "damn it!"

484
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,867
Or maybe, "send me
the schematics of the track
on my PDA,"

485
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,567
That would have been
another good one.

486
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,800
That's very tidy,
through there.

487
00:24:32,833 --> 00:24:36,067
And in... Ooh, yeah,
that's very well done,
in that weather.

488
00:24:36,067 --> 00:24:38,400
Come on!
Oh, you're in fourth,
you prat!

489
00:24:39,633 --> 00:24:41,400
CLARKSON:  "Prat"
gives it away.
SUTHERLAND:  Yes.

490
00:24:41,433 --> 00:24:44,233
CLARKSON:  No American's
gonna say "prat,"
Or Canadian.

491
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:46,533
Tidy again.

492
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:49,333
Hit the brake
like you hate it.

493
00:24:49,367 --> 00:24:51,633
CLARKSON:  Yes, look at
the tight line there,
driving on the brake.

494
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:53,200
It does handle
very well, that...

495
00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:54,967
Ooh, now, wait.
You've got it
understeering there.

496
00:24:55,067 --> 00:24:58,567
SUTHERLAND:  Yeah.
CLARKSON:  That is
very slippery.

497
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,300
SUTHERLAND:  It felt
so much faster
when we were doing it.

498
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,967
CLARKSON:  Yes, it's...
It's tragic.

499
00:25:03,067 --> 00:25:05,800
Don't you dare
take your foot off,
you pussy.

500
00:25:08,867 --> 00:25:12,700
CLARKSON:  The thing is,
the slower it looks, weirdly,
sometimes, the faster it is.

501
00:25:12,733 --> 00:25:14,700
SUTHERLAND:  Yeah?

502
00:25:14,733 --> 00:25:16,867
CLARKSON:  See, that's...
Look at that, staying away
from the tyres,

503
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,567
very smooth again.

504
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,767
I don't know
what the time is yet,
I haven't seen.

505
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,400
SUTHERLAND:  This is
the tricky part.

506
00:25:23,433 --> 00:25:24,700
CLARKSON:  Oh, that's
a tricky corner,
that is.

507
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:26,233
SUTHERLAND:  Oh,
it's mean.

508
00:25:26,267 --> 00:25:28,133
CLARKSON:  But that was
beautifully done.

509
00:25:28,167 --> 00:25:31,567
And again, beautifully done
'round Gambon,
and across the line!

510
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,933
There you go.
Thanks very much.

511
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:37,367
CLARKSON: Well,
there we are.

512
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,267
So...

513
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:48,067
Where do you
think you've come?

514
00:25:48,067 --> 00:25:49,767
Oh, gosh.
I have no idea.

515
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,100
CLARKSON: Bearing in mind,
okay, these are all
dry laps up here.

516
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,400
SUTHERLAND: This is where
I need my glasses.

517
00:25:53,433 --> 00:25:55,067
CLARKSON: The wet ones
start with James Blunt.

518
00:25:55,067 --> 00:25:57,767
I can't remember what
"fw" stands for.
I think, "fairly."

519
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,867
Anyone? But it
might not be.

520
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,233
Oh, "fairly wet," yeah.

521
00:26:01,267 --> 00:26:03,433
I think our fastest
wet lap we've had so far,

522
00:26:03,467 --> 00:26:07,867
at a 1, what is it, 49.4?
What do you think?

523
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,167
I really haven't a clue.

524
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,500
Okay, Kiefer Sutherland,
you did it in...

525
00:26:14,267 --> 00:26:15,900
-Well, 1...
-Good.

526
00:26:15,933 --> 00:26:17,267
CLARKSON: That's
not surprising.

527
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,733
What is surprising
in that weather
is the next one.

528
00:26:19,767 --> 00:26:21,333
-40.
-Okay.

529
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:25,433
-See, what's terrifying me...
-(Sutherland laughing)

530
00:26:27,067 --> 00:26:29,367
...Is if, and I like
James Blunt a lot,
he's a really good guy.

531
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,333
Mmm-hmm.

532
00:26:31,367 --> 00:26:34,800
But if James Blunt's
faster than Jack Bauer,
this could end  24, so...

533
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:36,700
Yeah. Okay.

534
00:26:36,733 --> 00:26:41,067
All right, here we go.
1.49...

535
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,133
AUDIENCE: Ooh...

536
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:45,733
-2.
-2.

537
00:26:45,767 --> 00:26:47,600
-So that...
-Will go where?

538
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,067
CLARKSON: Two.
SUTHERLAND: There.

539
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,900
Are you happy with that?

540
00:26:54,933 --> 00:26:57,567
I'm... You know what?
Yes.

541
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
I've never run on a track.

542
00:26:59,633 --> 00:27:02,400
I mean, anything I've ever
been asked to do in a car,
which is quite a lot of stuff,

543
00:27:02,433 --> 00:27:06,300
but they basically say,
you know, "okay, I want you
to go as fast as you can,

544
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:10,167
"start here, and then when you
see that bus, hit it,"
You know?

545
00:27:11,067 --> 00:27:12,800
That, I do really well.

546
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:15,533
Anyway, ladies and
gentlemen, can I just say
on behalf of all of us,

547
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,400
-thank you so much for coming.
-My gosh, thank you so much.

548
00:27:17,433 --> 00:27:20,467
-Kiefer Sutherland!
-Thank you guys very much!
Thank you.

549
00:27:26,133 --> 00:27:27,133
Right.

550
00:27:27,967 --> 00:27:30,833
Tonight, we are in Australia,

551
00:27:30,867 --> 00:27:36,067
trying to find out if
modern complicated cars
can survive the outback.

552
00:27:36,067 --> 00:27:41,733
Indeed! The producers had
told us to drive from Darwin
to a three million acre farm,

553
00:27:41,767 --> 00:27:44,500
where we would have to
round up 4,000 cows

554
00:27:44,533 --> 00:27:50,100
using a BMW M6,
a Bentley Continental
and a Nissan GT-R.

555
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:06,100
542 horsepower
from a twin turbo v6.

556
00:28:06,967 --> 00:28:09,600
It is absolutely ballistic!

557
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,867
The mid-range thrust of this,
when you're midway
through a corner it just...

558
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,933
-(Engine revving)
-Whoa!

559
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:24,700
Launches itself.

560
00:28:24,733 --> 00:28:29,400
I think, in this, you could
give pretty good sports cars
a pretty big surprise.

561
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:38,700
CLARKSON: In the early days,
BMW's M cars sounded like

562
00:28:38,733 --> 00:28:43,100
500 yards of ripping
calico and they had
telepathic steering

563
00:28:43,133 --> 00:28:45,433
and they were magnificent.

564
00:28:45,467 --> 00:28:50,133
In recent years, though,
some of the magic
has sort of gone.

565
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:52,800
With this one, though,
it is back.

566
00:28:55,933 --> 00:28:57,900
It is properly back!

567
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:08,300
God! This is just
electrifyingly good!

568
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:14,200
CLARKSON:  Soon, the producers
told us to pull over for some
kind of motor racing event.

569
00:29:14,233 --> 00:29:17,233
What manner of thing
will it be, I wonder.

570
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:20,567
CLARKSON:  The mystery
deepened when we arrived

571
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,433
and were given idiotic
health and safety outfits.

572
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,533
But then, all was revealed.

573
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,500
CLARKSON: Holy cow!

574
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:46,233
Most of the steel used to
build modern China came out of
this vast hole in the ground.

575
00:29:46,267 --> 00:29:49,467
But today, it would
be our racetrack.

576
00:29:52,933 --> 00:29:55,500
It must be a hill climb.
Like Goodwood.

577
00:29:55,533 --> 00:29:57,400
-MAY: yeah, it is.
-But it's not exactly
like that.

578
00:29:57,433 --> 00:30:02,000
Not, exactly, no.
Every single corner has got
a drop on it that's lethal.

579
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:05,800
Oh, hello. Oh, it's you.

580
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:09,200
"You will now take it in turns
to drive up the
hill climb course...

581
00:30:09,233 --> 00:30:12,467
-It is, yeah.
-"...Attempting to beat
a benchmark time."

582
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,500
And let me guess,
the benchmark time
is set by the Stig?

583
00:30:15,533 --> 00:30:16,967
It isn't the Stig.

584
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,900
But it is the Stig's
Sustralian cousin!

585
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:28,367
CLARKSON: He's bigger
than the Stig.
MAY: Mmm.

586
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,167
And he's got a bigger...

587
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,367
...Sausage.

588
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,067
-How did you find that out?
-Well, look!

589
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:38,967
-Even from here,
one can see that he's a...
-Hammond: Big Stig.

590
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,167
CLARKSON:  Big Stig would be
laying down the gauntlet in
a typical Aussie sports car...

591
00:30:44,867 --> 00:30:46,567
A Holden ute.

592
00:30:48,533 --> 00:30:51,600
-You know that,
whatever it's called, Maloo?
-Hammond: Yeah.

593
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:53,600
It's got more horsepower
than my BMW.

594
00:30:53,633 --> 00:30:55,000
-Does it?
-Two more.

595
00:30:56,433 --> 00:30:58,567
Three... Two... One... Go!

596
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:08,367
Whoa! That's a spectacular
thing to look at!

597
00:31:15,633 --> 00:31:18,067
Whoa! He's gone a bit
sideways there!

598
00:31:18,067 --> 00:31:19,067
What?

599
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,467
-Hammond: Am I the only one
who really likes that ute?
-Yes, you are.

600
00:31:31,633 --> 00:31:33,367
And then ready, steady, and...

601
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:35,900
Across the line!

602
00:31:35,933 --> 00:31:38,800
HAMMOND: Gordon Bennett!
He was... Oof!

603
00:31:39,867 --> 00:31:41,733
CLARKSON:  As Big Stig's
dust settled,

604
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:45,067
the three of us made our way
to the bottom of the mine.

605
00:31:45,933 --> 00:31:47,600
I'll win this.

606
00:31:47,633 --> 00:31:49,100
I seriously doubt that.

607
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:50,800
Well, I will or he will
because we've got

608
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:52,800
-four wheel drive.
-It's true.

609
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:55,567
Four wheel drive is useful
on a tractor, but on a normal
road car it's pointless.

610
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,267
It's like water.

611
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,567
-How's it like water?
-Well, 'cause it's neither
good nor bad,

612
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,067
it just doesn't do anything.

613
00:32:01,067 --> 00:32:03,200
Water is useful
for a lot of things.

614
00:32:03,233 --> 00:32:06,067
Well, it is if you put
hops in it or grapes.
But on its own...

615
00:32:06,067 --> 00:32:10,700
When was the last time
a rear wheel drive car won
the world rally championship?

616
00:32:10,733 --> 00:32:13,067
-Ha!
-Uh... Recently.

617
00:32:13,067 --> 00:32:16,633
-Not that recently.
-Well, in my mind it was.
It was 1983

618
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:18,533
-and that was yesterday.
-Correct.

619
00:32:18,567 --> 00:32:21,367
Ever since then,
it been four wheel drive and
that's a rally stage isn't it?

620
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,467
I shall do this first
and you will witness poetry.

621
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,600
Fire away.

622
00:32:26,633 --> 00:32:29,767
CLARKSON:  In front of a crowd
of bemused miners,

623
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,300
I prepared for my run.

624
00:32:32,333 --> 00:32:34,533
Traction control, off.

625
00:32:34,567 --> 00:32:37,167
Three... Two... One! Go!

626
00:32:39,367 --> 00:32:41,333
He's struggling
for traction already.

627
00:32:42,967 --> 00:32:46,100
Dive for second,
still spinning the wheels.
Third!

628
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:49,133
Still spinning the wheels.

629
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,867
Maybe I should've kept
the traction control on.

630
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,400
Whoa!

631
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:58,067
Slithering. Big slide.

632
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,967
God above!

633
00:33:03,167 --> 00:33:05,133
What if, all of a sudden,
whoosh!

634
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:07,200
And then we just saw
the underside of his BMW?

635
00:33:07,233 --> 00:33:09,233
MAY: I'd check
the exhaust is okay.

636
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:20,333
Come on, Beemer!
Give me that 575 horsepower!

637
00:33:23,867 --> 00:33:26,300
Four wheel drive
is for the weak!

638
00:33:27,767 --> 00:33:29,233
180 kph.

639
00:33:31,233 --> 00:33:34,333
And through the lorries
and across the line!

640
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,733
MAY:  Next, the Bentley.

641
00:33:38,767 --> 00:33:42,167
And the magnificent
country residence of the
Duke of Marlborough

642
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,533
takes its place
on the starting line.

643
00:33:44,567 --> 00:33:48,700
I'm gonna bias the suspension
slightly towards soft,

644
00:33:48,733 --> 00:33:50,733
because I might get
more traction that way.

645
00:33:50,767 --> 00:33:52,967
Three... Two... One! Go!

646
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,467
Grip, grip, grip! Good girl!

647
00:34:00,967 --> 00:34:02,933
MAY:  After just 100 meters,

648
00:34:02,967 --> 00:34:07,467
the four wheel drive
Bentley was four seconds
ahead of the BMW.

649
00:34:08,767 --> 00:34:10,067
Into the hairpin.

650
00:34:13,067 --> 00:34:16,100
Oh, four wheel drive
helped me around that a treat!

651
00:34:19,667 --> 00:34:20,900
(Chuckling)

652
00:34:22,133 --> 00:34:23,167
Hairpin.

653
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:28,433
The china and silverware
is going to fall over

654
00:34:28,467 --> 00:34:30,967
and make a terrible mess for
the butler to clear up later.

655
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,133
Right. Braking,
ready for the... Oh, god.

656
00:34:36,467 --> 00:34:37,533
Turning it.

657
00:34:38,733 --> 00:34:40,867
Come on, bite! There you go!

658
00:34:47,767 --> 00:34:49,600
(Chuckling)

659
00:34:49,633 --> 00:34:51,067
Right, viewers,
now we're alone.

660
00:34:51,067 --> 00:34:53,133
Look, that car should be
the fastest up that course,

661
00:34:53,167 --> 00:34:55,233
but with the best one in the
world, I'm not going to be.

662
00:34:55,267 --> 00:34:57,133
So, I've got a plan.

663
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:04,100
English Stig!
I've been carrying him
around for days.

664
00:35:04,133 --> 00:35:06,867
With English Stig smuggled
into the driving seat,

665
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,100
the GT-R readied for the off.

666
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,933
There he is, look. Hello.

667
00:35:11,967 --> 00:35:15,067
Three... Two... One! Go!

668
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:19,067
(Engine Revving)

669
00:35:20,967 --> 00:35:23,200
-That's quite a
vigorous start, actually
-Hello.

670
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:33,333
-Erm, that was a racing
line there. Did you see?
-Yeah.

671
00:35:40,733 --> 00:35:42,600
None of what I'm seeing...

672
00:35:42,633 --> 00:35:44,067
-Makes sense?
-...Is possible.

673
00:35:54,233 --> 00:35:56,067
HAMMOND: Oh my God!
Did you see that twitch
he did there?

674
00:35:56,067 --> 00:35:57,933
CLARKSON: He's twitching!
He's actually...

675
00:36:03,067 --> 00:36:04,400
Where's he going?

676
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,233
He forgot where
the end mark...

677
00:36:06,267 --> 00:36:07,600
Well, he did something
James May-ish.

678
00:36:11,533 --> 00:36:12,900
(May Groaning)

679
00:36:13,933 --> 00:36:15,500
Thanks very much.

680
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,100
Oh, here he is.

681
00:36:19,533 --> 00:36:20,967
-That was very quick.
-Yeah.

682
00:36:21,067 --> 00:36:23,267
-It was vigorous.
-Four wheel drive.

683
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,700
HAMMOND: It's a good car.
It flatters.

684
00:36:25,733 --> 00:36:27,233
-I'm not saying...
-It does. No. No.

685
00:36:27,267 --> 00:36:29,233
He was right to say it.
I, you know,
I wasn't that confident,

686
00:36:29,267 --> 00:36:31,067
but it does look after you
all the way.

687
00:36:31,067 --> 00:36:32,833
We have the times
here, anyway.

688
00:36:32,867 --> 00:36:37,400
The Australian Stig
in the HSV Maloo did a 1.17.8.

689
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:41,400
I was a little bit slower,
as it's turned out.

690
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:42,467
MAY: Really?
HAMMOND: Go on.

691
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:46,067
He was 1.17.8, I was 1.31.6.

692
00:36:46,067 --> 00:36:47,700
HAMMOND: That is slower,
isn't it?

693
00:36:47,733 --> 00:36:51,367
Bentley, 1.18.6.

694
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,833
-Oh! That's not bad!
-That's pretty good.

695
00:36:53,867 --> 00:36:55,133
I'm pleased with that.

696
00:36:55,167 --> 00:36:56,900
You were really...
You were only a second off.

697
00:36:56,933 --> 00:36:58,533
Yeah, I was on it
in the old Bentley.

698
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,267
Gt-r, 1.13.3.

699
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:06,833
Four and a half seconds
faster than a Stig?

700
00:37:08,133 --> 00:37:10,133
-Well, well done you.
-Thank you.

701
00:37:12,467 --> 00:37:14,433
CLARKSON:  As we got
back on the road,

702
00:37:14,467 --> 00:37:18,767
I could accept that
four wheel drive makes sense
in an iron ore mine.

703
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,967
But James' time? No.

704
00:37:24,067 --> 00:37:28,233
1 minute 13 seconds,
James May.

705
00:37:28,267 --> 00:37:32,933
It normally takes James May
1 minute 13 seconds
to go through a door!

706
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:34,500
How did he do that?

707
00:37:34,533 --> 00:37:39,300
And more to the point,
how did our cars do that?

708
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:42,233
To be in this Bentley,
hammering up that hill,

709
00:37:42,267 --> 00:37:45,067
you're asking a lot
of a modern luxury car

710
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,800
weighing the best part
of two and a half tonnes.

711
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,100
It did it.

712
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,100
HAMMOND:  After a
dirty, dusty day,

713
00:37:54,133 --> 00:37:58,067
we were looking forward
to staying in an actual hotel.

714
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,367
Sadly, though, this was
the only one for miles.

715
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:07,100
-Evening.
-Evening.

716
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:14,067
HAMMOND: Is that a bed?
MAY: Is it? Yeah.

717
00:38:14,067 --> 00:38:18,500
HAMMOND:  Jeremy therefore
suggested we should
leave immediately.

718
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:25,267
And try a new type of tenting
that he just thought of.

719
00:38:29,867 --> 00:38:31,300
HAMMOND: What are you doing?

720
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:34,333
Most people build a campfire
and then sit around it, yes?

721
00:38:34,367 --> 00:38:35,633
-Yes!
-What I've done,

722
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:38,467
is built the campfire
round us.

723
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,400
So we can sit in the middle,

724
00:38:40,433 --> 00:38:42,067
cook our salmonella,

725
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,133
and none of all the dangerous
animals can get at us.

726
00:38:45,167 --> 00:38:48,200
I have revolutionised tenting,
is what I've done.

727
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:49,800
Hang on.

728
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:51,233
HAMMOND: What are you
doing there?

729
00:38:51,267 --> 00:38:53,133
CLARKSON: What's the best way
of starting a fire?

730
00:38:53,533 --> 00:38:55,467
Petrol.

731
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,833
What must the world look like
from inside that head?

732
00:39:01,367 --> 00:39:02,600
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

733
00:39:06,733 --> 00:39:10,700
Behold!
I've made fire all around us!

734
00:39:10,733 --> 00:39:12,733
-HAMMOND: Brilliant! Jeremy!
-What?

735
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:16,433
One of the many advantages of
a single traditional campfire
that you sit around is

736
00:39:16,467 --> 00:39:18,167
that you can move
out of the way of
where the smoke's going.

737
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,933
Yeah, you can't with mine
but we are safe.

738
00:39:20,967 --> 00:39:22,600
Get down! Get down low!

739
00:39:22,633 --> 00:39:24,667
-Down low, it's better!
-I already am down low,
it's worse!

740
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,600
No, it's better here!

741
00:39:25,633 --> 00:39:26,867
-Anyway...
-What?

742
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,200
Where are the tents?

743
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:31,100
In the cars!

744
00:39:31,133 --> 00:39:32,933
-Well...
-You plum sack.

745
00:39:37,467 --> 00:39:40,633
CLARKSON:  The next morning,
after another dreadful night,

746
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:42,367
we were back on the road.

747
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:46,333
And after about four hours,

748
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:49,867
Professor Hammond
finally realised something.

749
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,633
Oh!

750
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:55,200
It's big, yeah,
it is big, Australia.

751
00:39:55,233 --> 00:39:59,867
CLARKSON:  We were headed
for the gigantic farm where
we'd be herding cattle.

752
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:03,033
And we decided to try
and reach it in one day.

753
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:08,400
The drive would be enormous!

754
00:40:08,433 --> 00:40:11,800
I spy with my little eye
something beginning with "t."

755
00:40:13,033 --> 00:40:14,433
Tree.

756
00:40:14,467 --> 00:40:17,300
I spy with my little eye
something beginning with "t."

757
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,400
HAMMOND: Termite mound.

758
00:40:20,433 --> 00:40:23,633
I spy with my little eye
something beginning with "t."

759
00:40:23,667 --> 00:40:25,433
It's tree! Just stop it!

760
00:40:26,433 --> 00:40:28,133
CLARKSON:  Since Hammond
wouldn't play,

761
00:40:28,167 --> 00:40:32,767
I tuned in to the only station
that my radio could receive.

762
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,633
MAN: (Over Radio)
Light weight heifers

763
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:36,933
out of Darwin,
heading to Indonesia,

764
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:40,467
are now fetching up to
$2.25 a kilo.

765
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:45,167
Feeder steers heading into
Indonesia up to $2.45 a kilo.

766
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,000
Why don't you play Steely Dan?

767
00:40:49,567 --> 00:40:52,733
Normally, you get some
excitement in this
part of Australia

768
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:57,533
when you have to
overtake a convoy
of gigantic road trains.

769
00:41:04,367 --> 00:41:08,100
We were actually quite looking
forward to the peril.

770
00:41:14,633 --> 00:41:16,400
A lot of dust coming up here.

771
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:19,467
CLARKSON:  But, in cars
as fast as ours,

772
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,933
it was a doddle.

773
00:41:20,967 --> 00:41:22,867
I'm out of their way.
I'm free.

774
00:41:25,167 --> 00:41:28,900
CLARKSON:  At 1:00, I had a
delicious Aussie lunch.

775
00:41:28,933 --> 00:41:31,300
(In an Australian accent)
Bloody hot ring burner!

776
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:35,067
And then, it was back
to business as usual.

777
00:41:35,067 --> 00:41:38,333
MAN: (Over Radio)
C2 heifers sold
from 160 to 176.

778
00:41:38,367 --> 00:41:40,800
Lightweight C3 heifers,
lifted four.

779
00:41:40,833 --> 00:41:43,067
They sell from 160 to 190.

780
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:47,267
And heavyweight heifers
returned up to 204 cents.

781
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,500
C2 yearling steer
at the feeders...

782
00:42:02,133 --> 00:42:03,667
CLARKSON:  Darkness had fallen

783
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:07,067
when we finally reached
the bottom of the farm drive.

784
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,167
Joy of joys.

785
00:42:12,067 --> 00:42:18,167
But it took another two hours
to reach the farmhouse
at the top of it...

786
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,467
WOMAN: Welcome to wave hill.

787
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,767
Thank you.

788
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,867
...Where there were no
spare bedrooms.

789
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:27,233
So, I decided to try another,
new sort of tenting.

790
00:42:28,767 --> 00:42:30,433
HAMMOND: Do you know what?
CLARKSON: What?

791
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:32,200
HAMMOND: We started this,

792
00:42:32,233 --> 00:42:35,567
I liked all three cars,
I still do,

793
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,800
but my conviction
that the Bentley is the best,

794
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:39,400
it's now absolute.

795
00:42:39,433 --> 00:42:40,600
-I just...
-(Clarkson snorting)

796
00:42:40,633 --> 00:42:42,967
I still find it
slightly, sort of...

797
00:42:43,067 --> 00:42:46,733
HAMMOND: What?
MAY: There's still a slight
hint of faux toffery about it.

798
00:42:46,767 --> 00:42:48,200
Which suits you
very well, obviously,

799
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:49,733
but the great thing
about the Nissan is,

800
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:53,100
it's just a finely-honed
driving instrument.

801
00:42:53,133 --> 00:42:55,067
Well, no, okay,
on the Nurburgring,

802
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,767
-yours is awesome.
-MAY: Don't mention
the Nurburgring.

803
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,667
-HAMMOND: But, that's
what it's for, James.
-No, it's not.

804
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,133
HAMMOND: And, Jeremy, your BM,
it does look brilliant.

805
00:43:01,167 --> 00:43:02,433
CLARKSON: There you go.

806
00:43:02,467 --> 00:43:04,100
MAY: It's a very competent
motor car, the BMW.

807
00:43:04,133 --> 00:43:06,667
That's damning with
faint praise, that is, May.

808
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,767
Yes, exactly.

809
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,433
Yours is a bit too
Dolce & Gabbana.

810
00:43:10,467 --> 00:43:12,400
Yours is a bit too Poundland.

811
00:43:12,433 --> 00:43:15,067
They're both brilliant cars,
make no mistake.

812
00:43:15,067 --> 00:43:16,733
What are you doing,
by the way?

813
00:43:16,767 --> 00:43:17,867
Claymores. They're mines.

814
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,567
I brought them from Britain.

815
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,800
Ring our campsite
with Claymores,

816
00:43:22,833 --> 00:43:25,233
then any animal that comes...
(Imitates Explosion)

817
00:43:25,267 --> 00:43:27,400
They will be...
It will become a veneer.

818
00:43:29,833 --> 00:43:31,200
When my work was done,

819
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:33,867
and May and Hammond
had drunk all the beer,

820
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,067
we turned in for the night.

821
00:43:39,633 --> 00:43:40,833
(Explosion)

822
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,867
HAMMOND: What was that?

823
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,867
CLARKSON: That was the sound
of me saving your life.

824
00:43:49,433 --> 00:43:50,800
HAMMOND:  The next morning,

825
00:43:50,833 --> 00:43:53,900
our campsite looked
like an abattoir.

826
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,600
What's this?

827
00:43:57,633 --> 00:43:58,800
Crocodile's ear.

828
00:43:59,433 --> 00:44:00,800
It's hairy.

829
00:44:00,833 --> 00:44:02,600
Crocodiles do have hairy ears.

830
00:44:02,633 --> 00:44:04,167
They don't even have ears.

831
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:07,233
They do.
That was a crocodile
that was coming to eat us.

832
00:44:07,267 --> 00:44:08,933
And my claymore
saved our lives.

833
00:44:08,967 --> 00:44:10,567
Look what we've got here,
Hammond.

834
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:11,900
It's a crocodile's hoof.

835
00:44:11,933 --> 00:44:14,833
You've detonated one
of the man's cows.

836
00:44:14,867 --> 00:44:16,667
Let's not get bogged down

837
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,233
with "ooh, blew-up,"
All right?

838
00:44:19,267 --> 00:44:22,167
Because I've been
reading about this farm.

839
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,467
Yes?

840
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,500
It's actually
3.2 million acres.

841
00:44:26,533 --> 00:44:29,800
So, another 200,000 acres
just slipped in there.

842
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,400
And to put that
in perspective,

843
00:44:31,433 --> 00:44:36,767
this single farm is the same
size as Buckinghamshire,

844
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,067
and Hertfordshire, and Surrey,

845
00:44:39,067 --> 00:44:40,900
and East Sussex,
and West Sussex,

846
00:44:40,933 --> 00:44:43,500
and Kent combined.

847
00:44:43,533 --> 00:44:46,567
It's the same size
as the south east of England.

848
00:44:49,933 --> 00:44:53,900
Everything you see here,
and a lot more besides,

849
00:44:53,933 --> 00:44:56,100
is one farm.

850
00:44:58,067 --> 00:45:01,300
And as we set off to do
cattle herding,

851
00:45:01,333 --> 00:45:06,067
we were still struggling
to get our heads 'round
the enormity of it all.

852
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:11,967
It's 250 miles from this farm
to the nearest supermarket.

853
00:45:12,067 --> 00:45:15,067
That's like driving
from London to Newcastle

854
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:19,500
just to buy some washing up
liquid and some bog roll.

855
00:45:19,533 --> 00:45:21,967
And it's not driving
on motorways,

856
00:45:22,067 --> 00:45:24,433
it's not the a1,
it's not the m1. It's tracks.

857
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:29,667
MAY: In Britain,
the average beef herd

858
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:32,900
is between, sort of,
28 and 50 cows.

859
00:45:33,867 --> 00:45:36,500
And here it is 64,000.

860
00:45:40,333 --> 00:45:43,433
Our task was to round up
4,000 of them.

861
00:45:43,467 --> 00:45:46,467
And we assumed this many
would be easy to spot.

862
00:45:48,067 --> 00:45:51,067
Now, have you raised
your suspension up, Hammond?

863
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:52,867
Yes, I have.

864
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,700
CLARKSON: Can you see
any cows?

865
00:45:54,733 --> 00:45:56,500
HAMMOND: No. No. Not one.

866
00:45:57,767 --> 00:46:00,267
But, we could be
in equivalent of dover,

867
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,667
and the cows could be
in Beaconsfield.

868
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:03,933
MAY: Well, I was just
thinking that.

869
00:46:03,967 --> 00:46:05,600
What if they're all
in the opposite corner?

870
00:46:07,067 --> 00:46:10,833
They could be a hundred miles
away from here.

871
00:46:12,933 --> 00:46:16,567
Even the high-tech
BMW was no help.

872
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,300
FEMALE AUTOMATED VOICE:
Voice commands, new entry.

873
00:46:19,333 --> 00:46:21,400
Spell name of place.

874
00:46:21,433 --> 00:46:22,933
Some cows.

875
00:46:22,967 --> 00:46:25,233
FEMALE AUTOMATED VOICE:
Did you mean sheep hills?

876
00:46:25,267 --> 00:46:27,567
No. Not "sheep." cows.

877
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,333
MAY: What's the noise
you make to attract a cow?

878
00:46:30,367 --> 00:46:32,600
If it was dog,
it would be, sort of
(Whistling).

879
00:46:32,633 --> 00:46:34,900
I don't know anything
about cows.

880
00:46:34,933 --> 00:46:36,900
Apart from
what they taste like.

881
00:46:38,733 --> 00:46:41,533
It is difficult to be a cowboy

882
00:46:41,567 --> 00:46:43,933
when we can't find any cows.

883
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,933
41 degrees out there.

884
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,067
No cows.

885
00:46:53,767 --> 00:46:56,833
After an hour's
meandering about, however,

886
00:46:56,867 --> 00:46:58,467
we struck gold.

887
00:46:58,867 --> 00:47:00,233
(Shouting) Cow.

888
00:47:00,267 --> 00:47:02,767
CLARKSON: Oh, there.
Yes, cows.

889
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,567
I'm counting, four cows.

890
00:47:05,367 --> 00:47:06,467
That is a start.

891
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,067
Get'em. Round'em up.

892
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,967
MAY: You two take the flanks.
I'll stay at the rear.

893
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,967
Yee-haw!

894
00:47:17,667 --> 00:47:18,733
Don't get too close.

895
00:47:18,767 --> 00:47:21,067
Panic'em, you'll
spoil the burgers.

896
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,900
We've got them. We have them.

897
00:47:23,933 --> 00:47:25,500
MAY: This is perfect.

898
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,667
(Mooing)

899
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:32,067
CLARKSON: We're brilliant
at this.

900
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:34,267
But, then...

901
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:38,100
They're going to break
and go in the woods.

902
00:47:38,133 --> 00:47:40,267
They're getting
into the trees.

903
00:47:41,133 --> 00:47:44,100
I can't go in there.
It's too rough.

904
00:47:44,133 --> 00:47:46,367
And even though Hammond
had four wheel drive,

905
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,733
it turned out, he couldn't
go in there either.

906
00:47:49,767 --> 00:47:51,833
(Engine Roaring)

907
00:47:53,533 --> 00:47:55,733
Erm, I'm beached.

908
00:47:55,767 --> 00:47:58,833
CLARKSON:  And by the time
James had pulled him out...

909
00:47:58,867 --> 00:48:02,467
Three, two, one, action!

910
00:48:03,067 --> 00:48:05,700
(Engine Revving)

911
00:48:05,733 --> 00:48:08,600
CLARKSON:  ...our four cows
had wandered off.

912
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:14,867
Sitrep. We found four cows
and we lost them.

913
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,967
So, what chance would we have

914
00:48:18,067 --> 00:48:20,333
when we found 4,000?

915
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,233
(Mooing)

916
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,500
CLARKSON: Right.

917
00:48:31,667 --> 00:48:33,567
Right.

918
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:38,667
This is the biggest flock
of cows I have ever seen

919
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,600
in my entire life.

920
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:47,133
Our job was to get
them all turned 'round

921
00:48:47,167 --> 00:48:51,500
and then herd them into
a giant pen which was
ten kilometres away.

922
00:48:53,267 --> 00:48:57,300
A pretty tall order
for three cars like these.

923
00:48:58,533 --> 00:49:01,400
It's like  Zulu, watching them
coming towards us.

924
00:49:08,733 --> 00:49:10,167
MAY: Here we go.

925
00:49:12,067 --> 00:49:14,967
CLARKSON: Has anyone got
any plans? 'Cause I haven't.

926
00:49:16,433 --> 00:49:20,400
Hammond suggested we break
the herd into smaller chunks,

927
00:49:20,433 --> 00:49:22,467
but that didn't work at all.

928
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:25,900
They're going in completely
the wrong direction now.

929
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:32,067
Oh, now they've come...
How are they...

930
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,267
What... They've gone...

931
00:49:40,233 --> 00:49:43,200
They're just going 'round me.
They're not very scared of me.

932
00:49:43,233 --> 00:49:44,567
MAY: Yeah, I'm in the middle.

933
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,167
I've been herded by the cows.
It's all gone wrong.

934
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,833
(Laughing)

935
00:49:48,867 --> 00:49:50,533
MAY: Clarkson,
where the hell are you?

936
00:49:50,567 --> 00:49:52,367
CLARKSON: I am now
in cow dust.

937
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,067
I can see nothing.

938
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,967
Okay, they're charging me.
This is unexpected.

939
00:49:58,067 --> 00:50:00,100
They're running towards me.

940
00:50:01,767 --> 00:50:03,700
MAY: We're in the middle
of the cows.

941
00:50:03,733 --> 00:50:05,467
We've been outwitted by cows.

942
00:50:07,167 --> 00:50:10,800
HAMMOND: Erm, nice cows.
Morning, cows.

943
00:50:10,833 --> 00:50:12,367
That bull is menacing me.

944
00:50:17,067 --> 00:50:19,333
This is a remarkably
brave cow.

945
00:50:19,367 --> 00:50:22,167
It won't be pushed back
into line at all.

946
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,033
Well, I say cow,
I mean massive bull.

947
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,900
Look, I may need
some help here.

948
00:50:28,933 --> 00:50:31,700
This guy is properly stubborn.

949
00:50:31,733 --> 00:50:33,967
I shall call you James May.

950
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,033
It fears the Nissan more.

951
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:40,567
CLARKSON:  As it turned out,
that wasn't entirely accurate.

952
00:50:41,667 --> 00:50:42,900
(Banging)

953
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:45,100
He is head-butting me.

954
00:50:46,233 --> 00:50:47,533
(Clarkson Laughing)

955
00:50:48,933 --> 00:50:51,167
He head-butted your Datsun.

956
00:50:54,467 --> 00:50:57,133
CLARKSON:  Meanwhile,
back in the Bentley...

957
00:50:57,167 --> 00:51:00,433
(Hammond Whistling) Jeremy!

958
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,633
CLARKSON:  Clearly,
things weren't going well.

959
00:51:04,667 --> 00:51:06,400
So, we made a decision.

960
00:51:08,567 --> 00:51:11,133
I think there are
too many for us.

961
00:51:11,733 --> 00:51:13,433
HAMMOND: Well, yes.

962
00:51:13,467 --> 00:51:15,733
We need the cavalry.

963
00:51:15,767 --> 00:51:18,467
And ten minutes later,
it arrived.

964
00:51:26,733 --> 00:51:28,800
(Laughing)

965
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:31,333
One of the most dangerous
jobs in the world,

966
00:51:31,367 --> 00:51:35,367
flying the
Robinson helicopters
to muster the cattle.

967
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,633
On average, one of about
eight are killed every year.

968
00:51:39,667 --> 00:51:41,267
Sometimes,
they will use the skids

969
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:44,500
to actually push
the cows into line.

970
00:51:46,167 --> 00:51:49,100
With the air-cav as backup,

971
00:51:49,133 --> 00:51:51,800
we started to get
our act together.

972
00:51:54,533 --> 00:51:57,733
Hammond, you are the rough
terrain response.

973
00:51:57,767 --> 00:51:59,367
And I'm the quick response.

974
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,100
HAMMOND: (Over Radio)
That's good, that's good.

975
00:52:02,133 --> 00:52:04,167
You channel them in,
I'll drive them forward.

976
00:52:08,767 --> 00:52:10,433
CLARKSON: Flank in, flank in.

977
00:52:11,233 --> 00:52:12,467
MAY: Go on, go left.

978
00:52:13,067 --> 00:52:15,067
Power sliding my horse.

979
00:52:17,433 --> 00:52:18,933
HAMMOND: Breaking right.

980
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,133
CLARKSON: Good work, Hammond.

981
00:52:21,167 --> 00:52:22,233
Good work.

982
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:28,400
That Bentley going
across that field
is a sight to behold.

983
00:52:28,433 --> 00:52:30,067
Look at its wheels.

984
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,467
Soon, we realised something.

985
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,600
Oh, there you go.
Look at that.

986
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:42,900
CLARKSON:  For once,
Top Gear  was being ambitious,

987
00:52:42,933 --> 00:52:44,433
and not rubbish.

988
00:54:14,767 --> 00:54:16,100
All right, cowboy.

989
00:54:16,133 --> 00:54:18,433
HAMMOND: I feel pretty manly.

990
00:54:18,467 --> 00:54:20,433
I feel like one
of those bulls.

991
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,067
HAMMOND: I loved that.

992
00:54:27,067 --> 00:54:29,767
-CLARKSON: God, that was fun.
That was a lot of fun.
-It was.

993
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:32,567
And these cars?
Better than horses.

994
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,933
-And nobody fell off!
-Much better.

995
00:54:33,967 --> 00:54:36,067
-CLARKSON: Yeah.
-But, can we just
stop for a moment?

996
00:54:36,067 --> 00:54:38,367
The amazing thing,
the cars survived it.

997
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,067
Nothing broke, all three.

998
00:54:40,067 --> 00:54:43,067
Fantastic! And if Nissan,
well actually, or Bentley,
or BMW,

999
00:54:43,067 --> 00:54:46,067
-if they made a laptop.
I'd buy it.
-Hammond: yeah.

1000
00:54:46,067 --> 00:54:49,867
You could throw a Nissan
laptop in the lavatory,
do a log on it,

1001
00:54:51,067 --> 00:54:54,300
and you'd still be able
to log on on it.
You would!

1002
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:59,333
Anyway, we must now decide
which of these cars
is the best.

1003
00:54:59,367 --> 00:55:01,767
Well, I'm not backing down.
It's the Bentley.

1004
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,867
I'm not backing down.
It is this Nissan.

1005
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:07,800
James, sorry mate,
you are just wrong.

1006
00:55:07,833 --> 00:55:10,667
The Nissan GT, it has
a whiff of the Nurburgring,

1007
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:14,200
no, it's not just a whiff
of the Nurburgring,
it reeks of it.

1008
00:55:14,233 --> 00:55:17,067
Your clothes will smell of it
six weeks after
you've been in it.

1009
00:55:17,067 --> 00:55:19,933
It's better than it smelling
of Ryan Giggs' bathwater.

1010
00:55:19,967 --> 00:55:24,333
No, no, it's a Bentley.
Think what that means.

1011
00:55:24,367 --> 00:55:25,733
I'll tell you
what it means, Hammond.

1012
00:55:25,767 --> 00:55:30,933
It means it is £66,000
more expensive than this.

1013
00:55:30,967 --> 00:55:33,567
Yes, because that's a Nissan!
That's a Bentley.

1014
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:36,733
Exactly! It's a Nissan,
and when you strip everything
off this Nissan,

1015
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:38,567
you find, underneath,
a racing car.

1016
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:44,200
When you strip all the stuff
off of that Bentley,
underneath it is a VW!

1017
00:55:44,233 --> 00:55:46,567
If we strip
all the stuff off you,

1018
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:50,600
we find underneath the same
basic skeleton as you would
find in a racing driver,

1019
00:55:50,633 --> 00:55:53,800
but when we put it
all back on, as we must,
to make you James May,

1020
00:55:53,833 --> 00:55:56,067
you're James May!
That's the wrong car!

1021
00:55:56,067 --> 00:55:58,233
Yes, but , Hammond
if we stripped everything
off of you,

1022
00:55:58,267 --> 00:56:00,633
we'd find the same
skeleton that you'd have
in a racing driver,

1023
00:56:00,667 --> 00:56:04,100
when he was a little boy,
but when you put it
all back together,

1024
00:56:04,133 --> 00:56:05,733
you are still
Richard Hammond.

1025
00:56:05,767 --> 00:56:11,467
You, in that GT-R,
is like you in those shoes.
Ridiculous!

1026
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:17,100
Says the man in the jacket
woven out of 100% pure 1935.

1027
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:22,067
That was designed
very specifically
for a purpose,

1028
00:56:22,067 --> 00:56:24,167
to feel good on the
ragged edge of performance.

1029
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:25,933
You're not going to do that.

1030
00:56:25,967 --> 00:56:27,867
You have a watch
that can go to the moon.

1031
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:30,800
You're never gonna go
to the moon. They don't make
moon boots in your size,

1032
00:56:30,833 --> 00:56:32,667
but you like
having that watch,

1033
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:36,467
because it means
it is a good watch, and
it's the same with the car.

1034
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:39,200
You're just being
a (Bleep).

1035
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:44,067
Thank you.

1036
00:56:45,167 --> 00:56:48,067
And you've got a
(Bleep) Like a
(Bleep) (Bleep).

1037
00:56:48,733 --> 00:56:50,200
A baby one!

1038
00:56:50,233 --> 00:56:52,867
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
gentlemen, I'm sorry,

1039
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:54,700
I'm gonna have to
interrupt at this point,

1040
00:56:54,733 --> 00:56:58,067
because the fact of
the matter is, by any
measurable muse you choose,

1041
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:01,900
-the BMW is the best car.
-(Hammond spluttering)

1042
00:57:01,933 --> 00:57:04,333
-But, I wouldn't buy one.
-Well, why?

1043
00:57:04,367 --> 00:57:08,600
Because fast, expensive BMWs
plummet in value
as soon as you buy them.

1044
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:10,567
You buy one of those,
within 18 months,

1045
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,167
you're gonna lose
£40-45,000,

1046
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:16,400
and as a Yorkshireman,
I just couldn't handle that,
really couldn't.

1047
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:19,300
-That means you have to
choose one of these two.
-I know.

1048
00:57:19,333 --> 00:57:23,067
I find myself, now,
with the casting vote.

1049
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:26,900
Um, the problem I have is,
okay, I'm at the precise age

1050
00:57:26,933 --> 00:57:31,367
when I'm growing
out of the Nissan and
into the Bentley.

1051
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,800
That's the problem
I've got.

1052
00:57:32,833 --> 00:57:34,667
And that is why you
should have this.

1053
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:40,467
The Nissan will help you rage
against the dying
of the light.

1054
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:44,500
Rather than any of that,
you can grow old gracefully
and in comfort in the Bentley,

1055
00:57:44,533 --> 00:57:47,167
which is a great place to be.
It's got quilted leather
in there.

1056
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,333
Hammond, quilted leather
is what an incontinence sheet
looks like

1057
00:57:50,367 --> 00:57:52,967
if you look at it
under a microscope.

1058
00:57:53,067 --> 00:57:55,200
I have made up my mind.

1059
00:57:55,233 --> 00:57:58,233
Right now,
I've made up my mind.

1060
00:57:58,267 --> 00:58:01,600
I'm gonna ditch my
Yorkshireness, not care
about the depreciation,

1061
00:58:01,633 --> 00:58:02,800
go for the Beemer.

1062
00:58:02,833 --> 00:58:05,433
Because, come on.

1063
00:58:05,467 --> 00:58:08,967
We never change our mind.
We never will.

1064
00:58:09,067 --> 00:58:10,933
CLARKSON: The thing is,
it's breathtaking, that car.

1065
00:58:10,967 --> 00:58:12,133
MAY: All right.

1066
00:58:12,167 --> 00:58:13,833
And on that bombshell,
it's time to end.

1067
00:58:13,867 --> 00:58:16,567
Thank you so much
for watching. See you
next week. Good night!
