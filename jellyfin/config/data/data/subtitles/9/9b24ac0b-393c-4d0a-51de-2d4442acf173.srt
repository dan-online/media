1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,480
How much longer to the embassy, my good man?

2
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:09,240
I'd say about twenty minutes, sir.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:10,490
Huh?

4
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:11,470
The brakes...

5
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,000
H-Hey!

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,620
You!

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,410
Look out!

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,420
Our diplomat in Ostania died in an accident,

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,420
but we at the bureau believe he was
assassinated by a certain Eastern far-right party.

10
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:34,380
They want a war with our
great nation of Westalis.

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,160
It is paramount that we uncover
the full extent of their plans.

12
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,390
We should send the best...

13
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,390
Our top agent,

14
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,970
Twilight.

15
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,280
As promised,

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,140
photographic proof that the foreign
minister wears a wig.

17
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,110
The negatives, too.

18
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,370
Good work.

19
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,540
This should be enough to make the man resign.

20
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,410
I'll call again.

21
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:01,910
Hey.

22
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,080
Now, the package you promised, if you please.

23
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,570
Huh?!

24
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,920
But I just—

25
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,550
They got me!

26
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,670
Codename, "Twilight."

27
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,490
The man was a spy.

28
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,190
In an age where nations the world over
engaged in a relentless secret information war,

29
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:30,140
the man had worn some hundred faces
to survive just as many battles.

30
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,980
So, Papa says some guy "stole the wig
pics," and he has to take it out on me!

31
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:38,050
I don't get it!

32
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,070
It's crap, you know?

33
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,250
Hey, are you even listening, Robert?

34
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,000
Hmm?

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,580
Yeah, that's rough.

36
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,950
Hey, Robert.

37
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,540
You think, one day, we might—

38
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,270
Karen, let's break up.

39
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:51,920
What?!

40
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,060
Your conversation lacks intellect.

41
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:55,830
Goodbye.

42
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,860
I wish you all the best.

43
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,760
Wait,

44
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,020
Robert!

45
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,250
Where'd that come from?!

46
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:01,600
Robert!

47
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,410
Sorry, Karen,

48
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,600
but my business with you
and your father is done.

49
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,600
After tonight, I'm done being Robert.

50
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,350
Marriage?

51
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,970
An average life of happiness?

52
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,910
I left any attachment to such prospects behind,
along with my papers, the day I became a spy.

53
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,230
Meow.

54
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:31,270
Cipher C, huh?

55
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,500
The train to Berlint will shortly
be departing from platform five.

56
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,030
Hello or good evening, Mr. Twilight.

57
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,260
Good work on the last mission.

58
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,130
Thanks to you, the minister can keep his post,
where he may prove an asset to our nation.

59
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,770
Now, as for your next mission,

60
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,210
your target is the president of the
National Unionist Party, Donovan Desmond.

61
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,030
A dangerous man, and a threat
to peace between east and west.

62
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:02,540
Your job is to get close to him,
and investigate his movements.

63
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,670
To that end, first,

64
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,800
get married and have a child.

65
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:07,860
Pardon?!

66
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,050
Desmond is a cautious man,
who rarely shows his face in public.

67
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:18,080
He has only been known to appear at the
social events hosted by his son's prestigious school.

68
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,210
These gatherings are a place for the
financial and political elite to rub shoulders.

69
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:27,380
You must get your child into that school,
and infiltrate these gatherings.

70
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,890
Furthermore, the school
admissions deadline is soon.

71
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,190
You have one week.

72
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,560
How do I make a kid in seven days?!

73
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,440
Excuse me.

74
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,300
Operation Strix.

75
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:46,150
This mission is vital to ongoing peace
between east and west, and thus, the world.

76
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,050
Dear unsung heroes,

77
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:51,080
the work you do will
never see the light of day.

78
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,560
There will be no medals,
not one small article in the paper.

79
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,590
Nonetheless,

80
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,840
never forget that your sacrifice forms the
basis upon which the people live their lives.

81
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,540
Very well...

82
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,910
I lost my name and face
to become Twilight.

83
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,180
I'll play the part of a father.

84
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,350
If that's what it takes
to build a better world.

85
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:15,860
"Operation 'Strix' <Owl>"

86
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,720
Here we have the family apartment.

87
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,519
Fully furnished, with heating and
air conditioner, as well as...

88
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,860
Um, sir?

89
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,440
No bugs.

90
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,660
Easy escape route.

91
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,840
I'll take it.

92
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,050
Then, Mr. Forger,

93
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,500
if you could sign these papers...

94
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,620
Loid Forger,

95
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,390
a psychiatrist.

96
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,580
My latest life.

97
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,480
A loving family,

98
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,870
a happy household...

99
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,490
Isn't it wonderful, finding
a home for your family?

100
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,730
Do you have a little boy, or a little girl?

101
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,440
Oh, that's...

102
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,620
...undecided.

103
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,580
Huh?

104
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,470
It's the last thing a spy needs.

105
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:54,810
What?

106
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:57,100
You wanna adopt a kid?

107
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,180
Indeed.

108
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,580
I heard this orphanage
offers adoptions, and...

109
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,350
The truth is, my wi—

110
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,110
Sure.

111
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,420
Take your pick of the litter.

112
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:05,920
Huh?

113
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,370
Come on in.

114
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,450
The state of this place...

115
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:14,270
However, there are more children of unknown
origin in these obscure institutions,

116
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,840
which helps when it comes
to doctoring their history.

117
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:19,130
This mission needs a kid,
and I'll figure the rest out.

118
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,500
Really, I'd rather handle
the whole thing myself.

119
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,240
Still, while I may be the
best spy in Westalis,

120
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,390
even I can't pass myself off as a child.

121
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,450
Oh, sorry, I'm looking for a child
who can read and write, if possible.

122
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,890
Hmm, in that case...

123
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,680
Hey, Anya!

124
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,340
She's the smartest one we've got.

125
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,400
Doesn't talk much, but she's not a bad kid.

126
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,840
Creepy brat! Can't say I like her.

127
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,320
I just want her out of here quickly.

128
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,530
Come on, say hello to the man.

129
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,280
Err, excuse me...

130
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,280
Age of admission at Eden
College was six, I think.

131
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,130
This girl's clearly four or five, at most.

132
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:54,790
Six!

133
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,630
Hmm?

134
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,520
Six.

135
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,790
Oh, huh, you're six?

136
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,370
But she's so small though...

137
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,800
The paper?

138
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,220
The crossword?

139
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,210
That's a bit beyond a child, isn't it?

140
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,910
Though, I'd say it's child's play.

141
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,740
One down, "homeostasis."

142
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,720
One across, "determinism."

143
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,370
Then, under that, "symplectomorphism."

144
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,530
She did it?! For real?!

145
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,530
What a fearsome intellect!

146
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,760
She'd get through the
entrance exam, no problem!

147
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,530
I'll take her.

148
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,230
Now, if there's paperwork—

149
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,370
Never mind that.

150
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,380
Just take her off my hands, already!

151
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,020
I have a kid. Mission accomplished.

152
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,200
That was almost too easy.

153
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,630
You okay with that?

154
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,290
Spy!

155
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,360
Mission!

156
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,620
So excited!

157
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,130
The girl was a psychic.

158
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,480
Subject No. 007.

159
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,630
The girl could read minds.

160
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:58,650
A certain organization had made her,
through science and chance.

161
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,600
She would later flee the facility,

162
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,600
and drift from place to place
in search of a guardian.

163
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,740
Listen up, little lady.

164
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,590
Anya!

165
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,140
Listen up, Anya.

166
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,140
I took you in as my daughter today,

167
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,150
but I want those around us to
think you were with me from birth.

168
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,030
You understand?

169
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:13,820
Aye.

170
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,160
Address me as "Dad," alright?

171
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,270
Father.

172
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,160
Right.

173
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,830
My, what a little darling! Hello!

174
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,570
We just moved in. Forger's the name.

175
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,170
I'm Anya, and I've been
Father's child for ages.

176
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,350
Oh?

177
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:29,730
Not helpful.

178
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,680
Alright, let's head in.

179
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,890
My house?

180
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:34,590
Yep.

181
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,930
TV!

182
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,200
Turn it on, if you want.

183
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,220
- Adventure awaits in... Spy Wars!

184
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,800
- I like this!
- Adventure awaits in... Spy Wars!

185
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,670
Well, I never...

186
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,120
You got a gun with a silencer, eh?

187
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,070
So excited!

188
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,860
You're a pro!

189
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,270
First off, I have to get everything I need,

190
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,690
and get some papers forged for the girl.

191
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,260
Right, I'm going out for a bit.

192
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,960
You watch that and wait here.

193
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,730
Adventure!

194
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,830
It's not an adventure! It's just shopping!

195
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,850
I want a pistol that doesn't make a sound!

196
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,340
Sure, if they have one on sale.

197
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:16,080
Never stand out, and always act
normal. The essence of espionage!

198
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,600
We must appear as a most
ordinary parent and child.

199
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,180
Father! Help!

200
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,320
Why must she stand out?

201
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,430
Oh dear.

202
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,760
You really ought to keep
a hold of your little one.

203
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,600
Here.

204
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,530
With one hand full, I'm hardly best
prepared in case of an enemy strike,

205
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,440
but it can't be helped.

206
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,780
Enemy?!

207
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,179
What are you doing?

208
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,000
Taking cover!

209
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,370
Did I do something to make her run for cover?

210
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,910
Was it too soon to hold hands?

211
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,050
Does she hate me?

212
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:49,900
Not good.

213
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,380
I need to stay on good terms with this
girl, for the sake of the mission.

214
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,480
I need to know more... about this organism.

215
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,390
Like with diplomacy, step one for
lasting peace is learning about others.

216
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:02,270
Learning about me means world peace!

217
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,320
I like peanuts!

218
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,910
I hate carrots!

219
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,320
I like crunchy bacon!

220
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:14,800
"Bakery" doesn't mean
"crunchy bacon," you know?

221
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,320
Can I have this, please?

222
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,700
You can't buy something that costs
one dalc, with a ten pent coin.

223
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,320
I'm starting to think this
girl's none too bright.

224
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,090
Was the crossword pure luck?

225
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,880
Maybe I can still swap her for another kid—

226
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,880
D-Don't throw me out!

227
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,900
Where'd that come from?!

228
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,440
Gosh, some parents!

229
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,740
I'm a good deal!

230
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,130
What do I do?!

231
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,220
Stop crying, I'll buy you some peanuts!

232
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:45,270
Peanuts!

233
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,600
Father,

234
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,310
I'm sleepy...

235
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,710
Can't walk.

236
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,960
I give up.

237
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,800
I don't understand...

238
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,910
...the utter absurdity of her behavior!

239
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:03,990
I'll need manuals to decode this one...

240
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,000
"Trust is the most essential
part of parenting."

241
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:11,500
"Don't scold, sympathize. Try to see
things from your child's point of view."

242
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,010
"Children aren't good at verbalizing
their thoughts and feelings."

243
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,040
"You have to be intuitive with children."

244
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,010
So, I guess interrogations are a no go.

245
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,510
I really don't know how parents do what
they do. It feels like mission impossible.

246
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,300
"Nurture self-esteem to prepare
your child for the future."

247
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,400
"Teach your child to think for
themselves, so when they grow up..."

248
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,440
Once the mission's over,
she's going back to the orphanage.

249
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,660
That's the sum total of our relationship.

250
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,670
No!

251
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,170
I hate studying!

252
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:51,630
I need to know your academic level
to prepare for the entrance exam.

253
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,820
I don't need to study! I can do the test!

254
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,130
I just listen out for pe—

255
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,130
People's thoughts!

256
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,440
What? Are you planning on cheating?

257
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,790
Look, if you don't get in, it's mi—

258
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:02,850
Mission failed.

259
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,750
Fine!

260
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,310
I'm going out.

261
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,810
You're not coming this time!

262
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:15,200
Not today!

263
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,420
You stay right here!

264
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:22,700
Hey!

265
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,660
What did I just say?!

266
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,660
You there! I see you!

267
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,080
There!

268
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,290
There!

269
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,860
Father's on a full-on finding-spree...

270
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,750
Fun!

271
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,760
Bet you can't get out now!

272
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,760
So that's why you were late?

273
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:43,760
In the end, I barricaded the
damn front door to seal her in!

274
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,610
Here's hoping that no one
reports you for child abuse.

275
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:49,100
Still, I really don't know what
goes on inside a child's head.

276
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,550
The way they try to cry away
any problem ticks me off.

277
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,810
Crying is pretty much part of
their job description, Mr. Twilight.

278
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,300
Anyway, here. As per your request...

279
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,860
Application form, exam
ticket, and exam questions.

280
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:03,140
Not an easy thing to get, you know?

281
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,700
You're a lifesaver, Franky.

282
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,370
Even she can get in if I can
get the answers in her head.

283
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,320
Oh yeah! The kid!

284
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,620
The orphanage had no records
for her, but I found them!

285
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,870
Nothing on her birth.

286
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:16,470
Age and parents, both unknown.

287
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,740
Couldn't find anything
beyond the last year or so,

288
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,690
but she's been in four foster
homes, returned each time.

289
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,680
Bounced between a fair few orphanages, too.

290
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,140
Anya Williams.

291
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,240
Anya Levski.

292
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,330
Anya Roche.

293
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:30,950
Swapping names left, right, and
center! Like father, like daughter!

294
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,000
Huh?

295
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,380
I'm kidding, man.

296
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,400
It's the mission, I know.

297
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,980
Sure, she's just a kid, but it's never
a good idea to get too attached, eh?

298
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,640
I'll keep that in mind.

299
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,880
Hey! My fee!

300
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,200
Geez...

301
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,990
Well, I for one really don't know
what goes on inside a spy's head.

302
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,710
Bored.

303
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,040
Being a spy isn't what I thought.

304
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,840
I want to get a bomb back.

305
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:03,470
I can't have her playing with my spy
gadgets, so I'll keep them locked up.

306
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,980
The combination is six, one...

307
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,040
...one, zero.

308
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,220
Bomb! Bomb!

309
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:17,480
Bomb! Bomb!

310
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,300
Whoa!

311
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,980
Secret comms!

312
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,990
Secret! Secret!

313
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,300
Boss,

314
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,490
we've intercepted new comms.

315
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,640
Western ciphers?

316
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,410
No, sir. Seems like plain text.

317
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,340
Err...

318
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,280
"Twilight..."

319
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,210
"...on the scene..."

320
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,550
"Twilight on the scene"?!

321
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,920
This is the frequency that
the western agents use, sir.

322
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,280
Oh, there's more!

323
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,300
"Tag..."

324
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,380
"...you're it."

325
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,590
Find the transmission source, now!

326
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,520
So, you know I'm a spy? You must be silenced!

327
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,940
He can't know I'm a psychic, either,

328
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,070
or I'll have to leave.

329
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:05,940
Anya, you must tell no one of
your power, you understand?

330
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,560
Now, it's time you got back
to your studies, Anya.

331
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,280
I want to do drawings.

332
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:13,080
You've no need for such childish frivolities.

333
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,290
We must use your power to
bring peace to the world.

334
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,410
We have no time to waste on tears.

335
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,290
Now, stop playing, get studying.

336
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,380
She'd better not have trashed the room.

337
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,890
Oh, right. I have to shift this thing.

338
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,350
Hmm?

339
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,220
Who the hell are they?!

340
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:56,700
Anya!

341
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:58,960
Anya!

342
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,170
She's been taken?

343
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,040
By this bunch?

344
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,000
Why?

345
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,460
I'll find them.

346
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,340
Calm down.

347
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,900
Judging by this scene,
the enemy knows I'm a spy.

348
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,560
I need to make myself scarce, now.

349
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,460
As for Anya...

350
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,370
There are plenty of other kids out there.

351
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:21,300
I'll just have to start again from scratch.

352
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,080
What the hell is this brat doing here?

353
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,800
What? Is she Twilight's kid?

354
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,120
We don't know, boss.

355
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,950
She was in the room with the transmission
source, so we took her...

356
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,160
It was the comms!

357
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,460
She'd holed herself in, with a big
barricade built outside the room.

358
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,480
Outside? Why?

359
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,450
Don't know.

360
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,860
Well, fine.

361
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,900
If she's got any value as a
hostage, then we'll use her,

362
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:48,010
and get Twilight himself to go
grab the foreign minister's wig.

363
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:48,960
Boss,

364
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,180
why don't we give up on the wig—

365
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:54,380
Transparency is important in politics.

366
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,680
Wigs are bad.

367
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,800
A pistol that doesn't make a sound...

368
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,820
Moreover, the minister is a traitor
who works with the west in secret.

369
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,690
Those who defend traitors
are traitors themselves.

370
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,190
A real bad guy!

371
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:12,730
Boss, Nguyen's group is
back from the apartment!

372
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,450
We got the man.

373
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,950
Good work.

374
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,970
He moved like a pro.

375
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,220
He's the real deal, sir.

376
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,070
Go take five.

377
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:24,960
Alright.

378
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,740
Now then, Mr. Twilight,

379
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:30,460
if you could kindly return
those photos you stole.

380
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,400
Nguyen?!

381
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,320
What's going on?!

382
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:33,740
He just—

383
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,760
The girl's gone!

384
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,720
He got us, again!

385
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,180
I screwed up!

386
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,890
Walking into enemy territory,
taking any number of risks!

387
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,030
I'm a failure of a spy!

388
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:42,920
Father!

389
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,680
Fa—

390
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,330
Whoa! It's okay!

391
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,630
I'm not gonna hurt you.

392
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,230
Don't worry!

393
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,940
Darn brats...

394
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:57,530
Oh, I think I kind of get why it
ticks me off when I see a kid crying.

395
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,340
It reminds me of myself when I was little.

396
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,910
No one ever offered me a hand.

397
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:07,540
The despair, loneliness, and sense of
powerlessness, when all I could do was weep.

398
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,740
I thought I'd left my past behind, but
somewhere in my mind, I'd seen myself in her.

399
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,060
No, what's more...

400
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,780
Listen up, little lady.

401
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,930
Anya.

402
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,550
Listen up, little Anya.

403
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:26,190
You see, we're all a group
of professional tag-players.

404
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:30,570
When we see anyone that looks like
promising talent, we challenge them, out of the blue.

405
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,270
Huh...

406
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,780
Father's a liar.

407
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,280
Now,

408
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:38,030
if you go straight, then head down the
street on the right, you'll find a police station.

409
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:41,700
If you can get there and hand this
to a police officer, you win.

410
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,590
Got it?

411
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:46,080
If she shows them this, they'll
take her in at a better orphanage.

412
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,780
I won't involve any children in my plans.

413
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:48,920
- I'll find another way to do it.

414
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,870
- Father.
- I'll find another way to do it.

415
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,850
Alright, go! Now!

416
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,710
A failure of a spy?

417
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,880
No,

418
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,760
but I did screw up the moment
I dragged her into harm's way.

419
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,710
I remember now...

420
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,520
I wanted to make a world
where no kid has to cry.

421
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,930
That's why I became a spy.

422
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,610
That bastard's not getting away this time!

423
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,780
We'll drag him out, and get a
good look at his ugly mug—

424
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,360
A trap?! When did he—

425
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,910
What the hell is this?! Flour?!

426
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,120
T-Twilight?!

427
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,830
Don't shoot, or the whole place will blow!

428
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,380
Wha—

429
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,880
You're kidding me...

430
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,820
Turn around, and you're dead.

431
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,390
Twilight!

432
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:46,020
Hello or good evening, Mr. Edgar.

433
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,290
How's Karen doing?

434
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,390
You! How'd you know my daughter's name?!

435
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,690
Of course, I know.

436
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,740
That's what spies do.

437
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,620
I know her height, her weight, her foot-size,

438
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,400
everything from her favorite food
to how many freckles she has.

439
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,040
While she's not as rotten as you,
she's also got her own laundry list of crimes.

440
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,600
Don't be absurd! My daughter would never—

441
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,520
Edgar, I also know that
you love your daughter.

442
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,250
Listen closely.

443
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:13,540
If you want her to live out her days in peace,
then never come near me, again.

444
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,710
If you get it, then hurry home.

445
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,520
Anya?!

446
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,450
Father!

447
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,550
Why are you...

448
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,660
Uh, no, what're you doing out
of the house on your own?

449
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:47,200
I mean, I wanted to go shopping over there,
but the place was closed down.

450
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,430
Father's a big liar.

451
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:52,160
I was playing tag with some nice men.

452
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,040
Is that so?

453
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,420
Did you have fun?

454
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,210
It was a bit scary.

455
00:19:57,850 --> 00:19:59,990
I wanna go home...

456
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,670
Back to our home.

457
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,220
Are you... sure?

458
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:09,060
If you leave me behind, I'll cry.

459
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:12,230
She's been in four foster
homes, returned each time.

460
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:14,240
Anya Williams.

461
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,900
Anya Levski.

462
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,230
Anya Roche.

463
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,940
I see.

464
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,130
Let's head home, then.

465
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,060
That apartment's dangerous
though, so we'll have to move.

466
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,780
I saw a nasty snake in there, yesterday.

467
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,750
I hate snakes.

468
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,670
Father's a big fat liar,

469
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,100
but he's a cool liar.

470
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,820
I want to live in a castle.

471
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,000
Sure, if we can get one.

472
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,870
Once we've moved, you've gotta study, though.

473
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:42,480
Wah!

474
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,870
Just look at the answers
and remember, this time.

475
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:45,960
It's easy.

476
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,150
Your exam starts now!

477
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,880
I'm counting on you, Anya.

478
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,100
Give it your best shot!

479
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,230
This is so hard!

480
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,060
I don't have a clue!

481
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,120
Which one should I pick...

482
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,000
Mama!

483
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:28,410
K-212.

484
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:31,950
There!

485
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,360
You passed!

486
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,520
Well done!

487
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,690
I did well?

488
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:37,020
You did so well!

489
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,880
So...

490
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,520
Father!

491
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,350
- The fatigue caught up with
me, the instant I relaxed...

492
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,530
- Don't leave me!
- The fatigue caught up with
me, the instant I relaxed...

493
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,000
- Father!
- I... relaxed?

494
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,780
- I'm gonna cry!
- I... relaxed?

495
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,530
- I'm gonna cry!
- Me?

496
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,430
- I'm gonna cry!

497
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,150
- I'll be a good girl, so please come back!

498
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,240
- I must be losing it.
- I'll be a good girl, so please come back!

499
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,910
- I'll be a good girl, so please come back!

500
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,140
Father is dead.

501
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,160
Postal service!

502
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,880
Are you Miss Forger?

503
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,420
I'm Anya Forger.

504
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,240
Could you pass this on to
your mommy or daddy, then?

505
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,640
Mother doesn't exist.

506
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,060
Huh?!

507
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:04,860
Oh...

508
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,730
Sorry...

509
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:06,780
Father!

510
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,860
The postman came!

511
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,980
What the hell?!

512
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,310
Have you come here to kill me?!

513
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,910
I fell asleep, right there
in front of everyone.

514
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,410
Damn, I need to get my focus back...

515
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:37,520
Post!

516
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:42,230
It's a notice from Eden College.

517
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,560
What's up, Father?

518
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,480
The second round of assessments
will be a parent-teacher meeting!

519
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,610
The child must come with both parents in tow.

520
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,120
No exceptions.

521
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:56,320
Mother doesn't exist.

522
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,880
"Secure the Spouse Role"
