1
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:20,300
HAMMOND:  Tonight,
James falls out of a boat.

2
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:23,033
I have a fight
with a gear lever.

3
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:24,333
-And...
-Hello.

4
00:00:24,367 --> 00:00:26,633
Oh, dear.
This is a bit embarrassing.

5
00:00:34,433 --> 00:00:37,533
Hello and welcome to
what's left of  Top Gear.

6
00:00:37,567 --> 00:00:39,200
And tonight's
programme is not,

7
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:41,133
as I'm sure you've guessed,
a normal one.

8
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:42,667
In fact, what we're
going to do is show you

9
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,167
two films that were shot
for the last series.

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,867
Yes, the second one
is tremendous

11
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,067
and that'll be
coming up later.

12
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,100
But I want to start with this.

13
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,633
It's a Jaguar E-Type.

14
00:00:51,667 --> 00:00:54,867
And thanks to
rocketing classic car prices,

15
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,533
it's now worth
about 200 grand.

16
00:00:58,567 --> 00:01:00,533
And it's the same
story with these two.

17
00:01:00,567 --> 00:01:04,133
The Ferrari Daytona
and the Aston Martin DB5.

18
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:06,800
Around 20 years ago,
you'd have been able
to buy either of these

19
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:08,567
for around 80,000 pounds.

20
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,067
But today, the Ferrari,
700,000 pounds.

21
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,400
The Aston Martin,
probably a million.

22
00:01:16,433 --> 00:01:18,667
But there are still
some classic cars around

23
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,800
that you can buy
for reasonable money.

24
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:22,667
The question is, should you?

25
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,067
Well, to find out,
the producers told me,
Richard, and Jeremy

26
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:28,400
to go and buy
a classic car apiece.

27
00:01:28,433 --> 00:01:29,733
And then turn up
with them

28
00:01:29,767 --> 00:01:32,467
at an old railway station
in Buckinghamshire.

29
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,567
They said we were
going to spend a few days

30
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,067
living the classic
car experience.

31
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,067
English country lanes,
warm brown beer,

32
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:42,533
and lots of fellow
enthusiasts to talk to.

33
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:46,467
Basically, Jeremy's
idea of hell.

34
00:01:51,467 --> 00:01:53,700
HAMMOND:  This was
the meeting point.

35
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:01,767
And I was the first to arrive
in my 1972 MGB GT.

36
00:02:02,933 --> 00:02:04,633
This is it.

37
00:02:05,367 --> 00:02:07,767
This is the daddy.

38
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,133
Think of a small,
classic, British sports car

39
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:15,800
and you are thinking
of this, the MGB GT.

40
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:17,667
Mechanically... (EXCLAIMS)

41
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,633
...it's not a bad example
of what is undoubtedly

42
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:23,333
Britain's most
popular classic car.

43
00:02:23,367 --> 00:02:25,800
At this point,
I was interrupted

44
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,500
by the arrival of
Captain Cheerful.

45
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,800
I say. That is pretty.

46
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,200
Why are we doing this?

47
00:02:34,233 --> 00:02:35,567
What? What do you mean why?

48
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,433
Look at it, 'cause of
everything about the day,

49
00:02:37,467 --> 00:02:42,467
the location, old trains,
classic cars, tinkering.

50
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,233
Hammond, listen, nobody
buys a classic television.

51
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:47,367
They don't say,
"Look, you have to

52
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,100
"bang it on the top
to make the picture work

53
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:50,667
"and it's black and white

54
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,367
"and then you have
to stand up to change
the channel."

55
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,533
So why would you buy
a classic car?

56
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:57,067
Because, well, look at it.

57
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:00,600
CLARKSON: No, I admit,
Fiat 124 Spider.
Incredibly pretty.

58
00:03:00,633 --> 00:03:02,500
Designed by
the same man who did

59
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:05,133
the Ferrari 275 GTS,
Lancia Fulvia,

60
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:06,533
De Tomaso Pantera.

61
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:09,500
But it will go wrong
all the time.

62
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:12,933
Yes, that's the point.
Then you can stop
and fix it yourself.

63
00:03:12,967 --> 00:03:14,500
This is not just a car.

64
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:17,267
It's something to
do at the weekends,
it's a project.

65
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,667
The Hoover Dam was a project.

66
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,633
A broken down car is
an inconvenience. It is.

67
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:27,267
And yours will
break down even more
'cause it's an MGB GT.

68
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,567
Deliciously and
delightfully simple. It's...

69
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,333
-Whoa!
-What? What, what?

70
00:03:31,367 --> 00:03:33,333
Has there been a knife
fight in the back of it?

71
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:35,567
Look at it.
The heritage, the history.

72
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,233
It's... This was
the poor man's E-Type.

73
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,567
It's horrid.

74
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,700
CLARKSON:  Soon we realised
there wasn't an elephant
in the room.

75
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:47,300
What do you think
the elephant will be driving?

76
00:03:48,133 --> 00:03:49,867
Well, it'll be a Triumph.

77
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,900
But I've thought about this,
it'll be, I think, a TR7.

78
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:55,967
Because he won't expect us
to expect that.

79
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:57,467
-He'll think that'll...
-Stag.

80
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,433
-But that's too obvious.
-No.

81
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:01,900
It's a Peugeot.
And that's right and proper.

82
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:04,333
'Cause he's old
and he never goes
faster than one.

83
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:05,967
He is basically
a Peugeot himself.

84
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:09,967
Is it very quiet? Or has it...

85
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:11,167
(MAY GREETING IN FRENCH)

86
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,067
-HAMMOND: It's electric!
-(CLARKSON LAUGHS)

87
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:14,267
Why isn't it running?

88
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,600
(STAMMERS)
I'm just saving petrol.

89
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:18,667
CLARKSON:
James, why isn't it running?

90
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,700
What do you think?

91
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:21,467
HAMMOND:
It's extremely pretty.

92
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:24,900
-That is a pretty car.
-CLARKSON: Pretty.

93
00:04:25,267 --> 00:04:29,633
MAY: Peugeot 304
Decapotable S.

94
00:04:29,667 --> 00:04:32,200
HAMMOND: That
means convertible.
MAY: It does, yes.

95
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:34,400
-CLARKSON: Decapitated.
-Beheaded, yes.

96
00:04:34,433 --> 00:04:36,133
-Is this you or him?
-It's mine.

97
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:37,300
Hello, hello.

98
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:40,200
Britain's most
popular classic.
Look at it.

99
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:41,400
So that must be yours.

100
00:04:41,433 --> 00:04:43,600
-BOTH: Yes.
-I sort of approve of that.

101
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:45,500
The only problem is
it's the American spec,

102
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:47,467
it's lived all of
its life in California.

103
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,333
-Those wheels are all wrong.
-I know.

104
00:04:49,367 --> 00:04:51,100
They had to raise it,

105
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:53,400
because to get the headlights
the American height
above the road,

106
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:55,400
they raised the whole car.

107
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:56,733
And that ruined
the ride height,

108
00:04:56,767 --> 00:04:58,433
and the wheels are,
as you say, wrong.

109
00:04:58,467 --> 00:05:00,200
MAY: Anyway,
let's be positive about it.

110
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,600
We've all got cars
styled by Pininfarina.

111
00:05:02,633 --> 00:05:03,667
He hasn't.

112
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,100
-I have.
-No.

113
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:06,867
This was styled
by Pininfarina?

114
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,167
Pininfarina, yeah, because
the convertible version
came out first

115
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,733
and a couple years later,
Pininfarina turned it
into this.

116
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:13,533
Pininfarina's dog.

117
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:16,700
CLARKSON:  With the classic
British weather beckoning,

118
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:20,333
we set off for a classic,
classic car drive.

119
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:22,467
-Where, which way
are you going to... Oh...
-Through the gate.

120
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,100
-Through the puddle.
-'Cause this is the S,
remember.

121
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:26,800
Go on!

122
00:05:27,467 --> 00:05:29,233
Oh, that sounds mighty.

123
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:30,967
Here we go!

124
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:42,833
This is everything
I hoped it would be.

125
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:43,967
It's an experience.

126
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:47,067
I can feel things
that are going on.

127
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,800
I'm involved in it.

128
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,333
There are those who say

129
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:56,400
there is no better sound
in the motoring world

130
00:05:56,433 --> 00:05:59,800
than the 1.8 litre engine
exactly like that one.

131
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:05,300
Oh, that does sound brilliant.
That's a proper car.

132
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:11,267
HAMMOND:  In the Peugeot,
James was upbeat as well.

133
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,967
This Peugeot,
I think you will agree,

134
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:14,500
is charming.

135
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:18,533
It is interesting.
It's French,
it's a bit leftfield.

136
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:20,067
But I mean, everything works.

137
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:22,467
Look, I mean,
the windscreen wipers
are working.

138
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:25,267
Erm...

139
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,067
Yeah, there's a clock.

140
00:06:28,633 --> 00:06:31,467
HAMMOND:
Meanwhile, in the Fiat...

141
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,533
This car is
absolutely horrible.

142
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:36,967
I mean the driving position,

143
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:39,767
they put the steering wheel
directly above the pedals,

144
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,833
so to get comfortable,
your arms have to be

145
00:06:42,867 --> 00:06:45,900
the same length as your legs.
And mine aren't.

146
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:50,433
Steaming up slightly.
I'll just engage the heater.

147
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,767
Oh.

148
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,600
Heater's not working.

149
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:57,400
Welcome to 1970s
classic motoring.

150
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,167
And a few moments later,

151
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,900
James made it
even more authentic.

152
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:04,867
(ENGINE SPUTTERING)

153
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,633
Hang on, hang on,
it's conking. Here it goes.

154
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,800
Don't stop.

155
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:17,100
Seven minutes and two miles
into the journey,

156
00:07:17,133 --> 00:07:18,833
he's broken down.

157
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:21,833
With the help of
a kindly local...

158
00:07:21,867 --> 00:07:23,067
HAMMOND: Pushing.
CLARKSON: Pushing.

159
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,367
MAY: Okay.
HAMMOND: Pushing.

160
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,933
CLARKSON:  ...we got
James going again.

161
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:27,467
-Here we go.
-HAMMOND: Maybe you
could dump the clutch.

162
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,167
CLARKSON: Dump
the clutch, James.
MAN: There you go.

163
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,333
-(ENGINE TURNS ON)
-Yes, thank you!

164
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,833
MAY: I can't stop.

165
00:07:32,867 --> 00:07:34,500
Now, I'm having to leave them.
That's a bit poor, isn't it,

166
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:36,833
but I'm sure they'll catch up.

167
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:41,300
We're off again.
That's all part of it.

168
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,133

Now, normally at this point,
we would do the news!

304

watch a famous person

blatting around our test track
in a Vauxhall Astra,

306
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,400
but obviously, we can't do
either of those things,

307
00:14:33,433 --> 00:14:36,900
so instead we're going to
give you some information.

308
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:38,733
Yes, the producers told us,

309
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:40,800
after we'd modified
our classic cars,

310
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:44,433
that during our journey
we would be facing
various challenges,

311
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,700
and that points
would be awarded
to whoever did best.

312
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:50,100
However, they also
told us that we would

313
00:14:50,133 --> 00:14:52,600
lose points for
every breakdown we had.

314
00:14:52,633 --> 00:14:54,700
So you've basically
lost already, then?

315
00:14:54,733 --> 00:14:56,800
No, rubbish.
Not necessarily, actually.

316
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,433
And that the person who
ended up with the most points

317
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:02,567
would get a special prize.

I came up with an idea.

319
00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:19,867

at this time of year is that

320
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,367
every single village,
pretty much
every single weekend,

321
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,233
hosts some kind of
classic car event.

322
00:15:26,267 --> 00:15:27,667

323
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,700
talk about their adenoids
and the "old girl" and...

324
00:15:31,867 --> 00:15:34,767
Well, I think we should
find one and go to it.

325
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:42,667
So we headed immediately for
a leafy village in Wiltshire.

326
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:47,667

what a classic car show

327
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,433

336
00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:31,400
Mitsubishi, Mitsubishi,
that's a Mitsubishi.

337
00:16:31,433 --> 00:16:35,367
So it's probably fair to say
we've got this slightly wrong.

338
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,333
Nevertheless, we were among
fellow car enthusiasts.

339
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:42,467
And once we'd got Hammond
properly dressed,

340
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,733
we were treated to
a spot of light drifting.

341

(TYRES SCREECHING)

342
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:57,067
That's June Whitfield
in that one.

343
00:16:57,067 --> 00:16:58,767
-Is it?
-Yeah.

00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:03,533
David Attenborough,
here he is.

345
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:05,300
HAMMOND:
He loves a bit of this.

346
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,133
That's a good one.

347
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:10,133
This'll be good.
Darcey Bussell,
she is brilliant.

348
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:11,867
CLARKSON: Go on, Darcey.

349
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:15,067
HAMMOND: That's a belter,
that was a good one.

350
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,733
MAY: That's a good one, yes.

351
00:17:20,633 --> 00:17:22,300
What?

352
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,800
It's not really that
sort of thing, is it?

353
00:17:26,867 --> 00:17:28,700
Right. "Even though your cars

354
00:17:28,733 --> 00:17:30,767
"aren't technically

-Well, not at all.
-Mine's completely French.

We're not going out
at the same time
as these guys, are we?

359
00:17:44,233 --> 00:17:45,467
Not right now.

360
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,900
Are we going to have
the track to ourselves?

361
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,067
No... No?

362
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:50,667
That's not right.

363
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:55,267
No, we'll be out
with other enthusiasts
of the Japanese car.

364
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,067
That's an...
Why would you do that

365
00:17:57,067 --> 00:17:59,067
in a 304 front
wheel drive convertible?

366
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:02,567
Come on,
enter into the spirit of it.

367
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,767
CLARKSON:  To make sure
he wasn't too much
of a nuisance on the circuit,

368
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:11,067
Captain Sense of Direction
had taken some precautions.

369
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,867
So down there,
that one's tight
with a bit of a crest.

370
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,333
Got to watch out for that.
That's reasonably quick.

371
00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:18,467
Got to go slow for that.

372
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,267
CLARKSON:  And with that
taken care of, we began.

373
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,067
Now the chassis in this car,
the Fiat 124 Spider,

374
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:32,100
went on to be used
later in the Lada Riva.

375
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:33,800
Oh, yeah.

376
00:18:34,933 --> 00:18:37,867
The engine though is
an absolute cracker.

377
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,433
1750 CC, 16 valve, twin cam.

378
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:48,733
This is what
my little MG was born to do.

379
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,833
It's a sports car.

380
00:18:51,867 --> 00:18:56,100
Live rear axle,
1.8 litre B-series engine,

381
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:58,700
pumping out
95 brake horsepower.

382
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:00,500
That's just enough.

383
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,967
Now, the standard Peugeot 304
had 65 horsepower,

384
00:19:07,067 --> 00:19:08,733
but don't worry, viewers,

385
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:13,767
because this is
the twin choke carburetted
S-version and has 74!

386
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:18,800
Sadly, however,
today, that wasn't enough.

387
00:19:32,433 --> 00:19:34,267
Yeah, they're all past safely.

388
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:39,767
Unfortunately, the man
who then overtook Hammond

389
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,967
didn't manage
his move quite so well.

390
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:47,700
HAMMOND: And he's lost it.

391
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:49,500
(LAUGHS)

392
00:19:49,733 --> 00:19:51,433
But then...

393
00:19:52,433 --> 00:19:54,300
A misfire is happening.

394
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:58,267
Oh, no, I think I am unwell.

395
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,867
Still, at least
I wasn't suffering alone.

396
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:04,400
Yeah.

397
00:20:04,433 --> 00:20:07,633
Yeah, you see,
ah, the oil's been...

398
00:20:07,667 --> 00:20:10,767
It's sloshing
from side to side
as I corner hard.

399
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,367
And some of it
has sloshed out now.

400
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,000

call, "Bottom-endy."

CLARKSON:  Having ruined
their cars too,

403
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,200
James and Richard
came into the pits,

404
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:27,733
where the producers
revealed our lap times.

405
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:31,467
I happen to know that
when the Mazda MX5 owners club

406
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,867
meet here for a track day,

407
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,100
so just ordinary people
who are vets and teachers,

408
00:20:36,133 --> 00:20:38,500
they lap in 1:25.

why we were so slow,

the producers told us to put
our cars on a rolling road,

423
00:21:13,767 --> 00:21:17,533
to see how much horsepower
they'd lost over the years.

have when it was new?

the turn of the MGB.

Then it was the Fiat's turn.

So, 85 is what it did have
when it was new.

are not really selling
these cars as cars,

because they're
largely terrible.

even small ones like these,

647
00:32:21,433 --> 00:32:23,967
can cost from around 25 grand.

648
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,200
And that got
our producers wondering.

649
00:32:26,233 --> 00:32:30,700
Can you buy into
the SUV lifestyle for less?

650
00:32:30,733 --> 00:32:32,333
A lot less.

651
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,700
Well, to find out,
they gave us each 250 quid.

652
00:32:35,733 --> 00:32:39,067
They told us to go
and buy a sporty SUV 4x4

653

to the Rutland Activity Centre

00:33:41,167 --> 00:33:42,833
Actually, it's better
in many ways.

675
00:33:42,867 --> 00:33:45,567
It's a monocoque,
not a separate chassis,
so it's more modern.

676
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,767
And unlike an Aston,
it's cheap.

677
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,367
25,000 pence.

678
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,500
-25... You've spent
the whole 25,000 pence?
-250 quid.

679
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:55,400
-You're mad.
-Well, hello,
what have you got?

680
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:58,067
This was built by Pininfarina.

681
00:33:58,067 --> 00:34:00,133
Built. Built by Pininfarina.

682
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:01,667
Built by Pininfarina.
Like a Ferrari.

683
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:04,167
-Right. And styled by...
-Mitsubishi.

684
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,400
Right, so built
by the Italians,

685
00:34:06,433 --> 00:34:08,067
styled by the Japanese.

686
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,467
Oh, that's
the perfect combination.

687
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,833
-That's exactly what you want.
-It's perfectly good.

688
00:34:10,867 --> 00:34:13,233
MAY:  At this point,
we heard the unmistakable

689
00:34:13,267 --> 00:34:15,567
sound of
an approaching orangutan.

690
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,633
(REVVING)

691
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:18,367
(CLATTERING)

692
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,167
-Hello.
-HAMMOND: Wow.

693
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:30,233
Now this is no ordinary
Vauxhall Frontera.

694
00:34:30,267 --> 00:34:33,367
HAMMOND: Well, no, it's
the loudest car in the world,
is what it is.

695
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,667
That's because this
is the Sport RS model.

696
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,400
-Is it?
-And because it has
a hole in the exhaust.

697
00:34:39,433 --> 00:34:40,933
The exhaust is
blown completely, yeah.

698
00:34:40,967 --> 00:34:45,633
But what is
genuinely staggering
is this cost me

699
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,567
14,000 pence.

700
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,067
Yes.

701
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,767
A replacement clutch
for a Vauxhall Frontera

702
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,233
is around about
300 or 400 pounds.

703
00:34:54,267 --> 00:34:57,533
So I have got here
a half-price clutch

704
00:34:57,567 --> 00:35:02,433
with an entire car
thrown in for free
and MOT'd and taxed.

705
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:05,733
Yeah, but, the entire car
is a Vauxhall Frontera.

706
00:35:05,767 --> 00:35:07,767
Yeah, you are left with...
(CLEARS THROAT)

707
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,933
What? Look, for 140 quid
I wouldn't care if it
said "dog dirt" on the grill.

708
00:35:11,967 --> 00:35:13,600
It pretty much does.

709
00:35:13,633 --> 00:35:16,333
And look what the chap has...
Look what... In the back.

710
00:35:16,367 --> 00:35:18,433
A swing-away door
so you can't open it

711
00:35:18,467 --> 00:35:20,833
in a supermarket or it's...
Oh, my God.

712
00:35:20,867 --> 00:35:22,333
How happy would your dog be?

713
00:35:22,367 --> 00:35:24,400
Look, in here is
the word "victim".

714
00:35:24,433 --> 00:35:26,933
They're not murderers' cars.

715
00:35:26,967 --> 00:35:29,667
That's for your hang glider.

716
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:34,600
CLARKSON:  Eager to test
our incredibly cheap machines,
we hit the road.

717
00:35:45,867 --> 00:35:49,133
Even though this was
only 140 pounds,

718
00:35:49,167 --> 00:35:51,267
the previous
owner has thrown in,

719
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,867
for free,
these air fresheners,

720
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,233
which give
the cabin the aroma of a hot

721
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,567
Turkish urinal.

722
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,867
And there's more.

723
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,233
In the centre cubby hole,

724
00:36:03,267 --> 00:36:06,567
I find he's left me
a pair of his old sunglasses.

725
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:10,333
And these earphones,
which come with traces

726
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:13,767
of his personalised earwax.

727
00:36:14,933 --> 00:36:16,367
Unbelievable.

728
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,433
And all of this is in addition
to what comes as standard.

729
00:36:20,467 --> 00:36:23,600
Functioning air conditioning,
electric windows,

730
00:36:23,633 --> 00:36:27,867
air bags,
electric door mirrors,
two sunshine roofs.

731
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:32,967
And the value for money
doesn't stop there.

732
00:36:33,067 --> 00:36:35,800
The scrap value of
this car is about,
let's say 200 quid.

733
00:36:35,833 --> 00:36:40,500
So if I crash it,
I'll be 60 quid better off.

734
00:36:41,833 --> 00:36:44,467
I can make money
by having an accident.

735
00:36:51,067 --> 00:36:55,233
I'll be honest,
I was deeply cynical of
this whole enterprise.

736
00:36:55,267 --> 00:37:00,667
But I just stood up and said,
"No way, you can't
buy 4x4s for 250 quid."

737
00:37:01,267 --> 00:37:02,967
And yet, here it is.

738
00:37:03,767 --> 00:37:05,533
It's not perfect.

739
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:08,800
Rear view mirror is not there.

740
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:09,900
Head rests have gone.

741
00:37:09,933 --> 00:37:12,367
Other than that,
there's air conditioning,

742
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,333
very nice stereo,
six CD multi-changer,
cassette player.

743
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:17,900
Nice touch of history.

744
00:37:17,933 --> 00:37:19,633
Loads of speakers.

745
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,233
It's brilliant. I've got wood.

746
00:37:23,667 --> 00:37:25,367
There.

747
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,867
I actually wrote
a review of this car
when it was new.

748
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:36,700
And I remember
being very impressed
at how good it was off-road.

749
00:37:36,733 --> 00:37:40,133
This has
a proper transfer box,
high and low range,

750
00:37:40,167 --> 00:37:42,067
and differential locks.

751
00:37:42,067 --> 00:37:46,233
It's only 1.8 litres,
but it is quite spritely.

752
00:37:46,267 --> 00:37:47,667
And it's very light.

753
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,567
It's almost 400 kilograms
lighter than the other two.

754
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,067
Mind you,
it wasn't all good news.

755
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,500
The previous
owner did warn me

756
00:37:55,533 --> 00:37:58,233
that one of the brake
discs was slightly warped.

757
00:37:59,433 --> 00:38:01,333
What he didn't
actually say was that it's...

758
00:38:01,367 --> 00:38:03,433
Well, it appears to be
bent at right angles.

759
00:38:03,467 --> 00:38:07,500
When you brake,
the juddering is appalling.

760
00:38:08,233 --> 00:38:10,633
It really doesn't... God...

761
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:19,400
CLARKSON:  Soon, we arrived
at Top Gear's  top-secret
lifestyle test track.

762
00:38:19,433 --> 00:38:21,800
Which is just
off Ladyhole Lane,

763
00:38:21,833 --> 00:38:25,233
one mile to the west
of the village of Edlaston.

764
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,567
At this
state-of-the-art facility,

765
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,867
we headed first to the indoor
winter testing centre.

766
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:36,067
Where we discovered
our cars weren't much good
on the, erm...

767
00:38:36,067 --> 00:38:37,333
Inclines.

768
00:38:37,367 --> 00:38:39,533
Up, up the hill!

(SQUEAKING)

770
00:38:40,767 --> 00:38:43,067
I'm trying to put it
in four wheel drive.

771
00:38:44,533 --> 00:38:47,533
Oh, no!
Something's gone wrong.

772
00:38:47,567 --> 00:38:51,567
Come on, no!
Why are you going backwards?

773
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,067
I can't...

(GROANS)

775
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,733
MAY: Bollocks.

776
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:58,467
I can't get it...

777
00:38:59,233 --> 00:39:02,133
(CLARKSON LAUGHS)

778
00:39:02,167 --> 00:39:05,267
CLARKSON:  We were then told
to report
to the oval test track

779
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,633
where we received a challenge.

780
00:39:08,233 --> 00:39:10,367
It's a game of tag.

781
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,233
You each have
a different start point

782
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:14,533
on the top-secret
oval test track.

783
00:39:14,567 --> 00:39:16,400
And you each begin at once.

784
00:39:16,433 --> 00:39:18,367
The object is not
to be overtaken.

785
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,133
If you are, you're out.

786
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:23,800
And to make
the test more relevant,
you will each have a ballast.

787
00:39:24,567 --> 00:39:25,567
A ballast?

788
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,200
That's what it says,
a ballast.

789
00:39:30,733 --> 00:39:33,067
-Right, this is
the "a ballast".
-Yeah.

790
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,833
-And actually, it is relevant.
-Is it?

791
00:39:34,867 --> 00:39:39,533
No, it is.
Because one of the leisure
activities done by SUV people

792
00:39:39,567 --> 00:39:42,300
is going on
holiday in a muddy field.

793
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:46,100
Yes, yes.
What isn't relevant is
the size of my caravan.

794
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,900
What do you mean?

795
00:39:47,933 --> 00:39:49,333
Why have I been
given such an enormous...
Look at the size of it.

796
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:52,600
No, no, the caravan isn't big.
Your car is small.

797
00:39:52,633 --> 00:39:54,500
-He's right.
-Makes it look big.

798
00:39:57,867 --> 00:39:59,800
CLARKSON:  Eventually,
we stopped bickering

799
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:01,933
and took our start
positions on the track.

800
00:40:01,967 --> 00:40:05,533
Where it turned out,
there was
a surprise late entry.

801
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,333
I know exactly who it is.

802
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:12,800
That, ladies and gentlemen,
is not the Stig.

803
00:40:12,833 --> 00:40:16,300
That is  Top Gear's
top-secret leisure Stig.

804
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:18,333
Useless driver.

805
00:40:18,367 --> 00:40:21,300
We use him only
for testing caravans.

MAN: (ON RADIO)
Three, two, one, go.

MAY:  Here we go.

808
00:40:31,433 --> 00:40:34,400
Testing, testing has begun.

809
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:41,067
I'm now unleashing
the 134 horsepower
Vauxhall Vectra engine.

810
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:44,467
Sadly though, leisure Stig's
driving was so slow,

811
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,400
that soon he was causing
a bit of a traffic jam.

812
00:40:48,033 --> 00:40:49,400
Oh!

813
00:40:49,433 --> 00:40:51,400
MAY: Why have they given me
such a massive caravan?

814
00:40:51,433 --> 00:40:53,033
This is hopeless.

815
00:40:53,067 --> 00:40:54,767
CLARKSON:
Well, it could be worse.

816
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,700
I can feel the downforce
from my "a ballast",
and it's good.

817
00:40:59,133 --> 00:41:00,800
Argh!

818
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:04,367
I've gone wrong.
It's hopeless.
I've crashed into myself.

819
00:41:05,633 --> 00:41:08,733
I mustn't be
overtaken or I'm out.

820
00:41:08,767 --> 00:41:12,800
Using the power of
the mighty Frontera,
I caught up with Hammond

821
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:15,333
and tried to take
him on the inside,

822
00:41:15,367 --> 00:41:20,233
which meant going
onto the surface
designed to test suspension.

823
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:24,267
This bit's even worse!

824
00:41:28,133 --> 00:41:32,800
Total chaos, and I've lost
all the ground
I made up there.

825
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,900
Because leisure Stig
was so slow,

826
00:41:36,933 --> 00:41:39,800
even James was
getting impatient.

827
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:41,500
Juddering, buffeting.

828
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,133
Come on, Pinin.

829
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,867
CLARKSON:  And violent.

830
00:41:48,767 --> 00:41:50,667
Oh, yes.

831
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,567
He's losing the wheel.
Massive error by the Stig.

832
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:56,067
Smoke is pouring off.

833
00:41:57,767 --> 00:42:00,333
Right, this time, Hammond,
you're going down!

834
00:42:01,867 --> 00:42:03,567
Ugh!

835
00:42:05,967 --> 00:42:07,667
Oh, no!

(CLARKSON LAUGHS)

837
00:42:14,233 --> 00:42:16,400

I'm on the rough stuff.

00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,733
Oh, this is impossibly...

00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:24,100
CLARKSON: Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry, Hammond.

841
00:42:24,133 --> 00:42:26,267
We have overtaken you.
You are out.

842
00:42:29,633 --> 00:42:31,667
I think I've lost a wheel now.

843
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:35,967
Lot of sparks.
It's barely controllable,
if I'm honest.

844
00:42:36,067 --> 00:42:37,700
(CLARKSON LAUGHING)

845
00:42:46,133 --> 00:42:48,900
Oh, now I can see
the problem here.

846
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:52,367
CLARKSON:  Meanwhile,
my race was going well.

847
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,400
Yes, I've just done James May.

848
00:42:54,433 --> 00:42:56,200
He's somehow ended
up on the infield.

849
00:42:58,067 --> 00:43:00,833
That was
a catastrophic mistake.

850
00:43:00,867 --> 00:43:04,833
CLARKSON:  But sadly,
I overcooked it trying to take
leisure Stig.

851
00:43:06,867 --> 00:43:08,567
(SCREAMS)

852
00:43:10,767 --> 00:43:12,200
(GROANS)

853
00:43:12,233 --> 00:43:13,933
Lost my brakes completely.

854
00:43:16,733 --> 00:43:18,600
CLARKSON:
With 20 laps completed,

855
00:43:18,633 --> 00:43:21,233
leisure Stig had given up.

856
00:43:21,267 --> 00:43:24,167
Hammond still thought
he was in the contest,

857
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,300
and I had a problem.

858
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:29,800
Steam coming from
the front of the Frontera.

859
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,333
Things are not
good in the Vauxhall.

860
00:43:33,367 --> 00:43:35,467
MAY: Yes, here we go,
I can have him.

861
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,433
-Come on!
-Uh-oh.

862
00:43:38,433 --> 00:43:40,767
It's tight,
it's tight at the back.

863
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,200
Manoeuvre attempt
by Jeremy Clarkson.

864
00:43:45,233 --> 00:43:47,067
Argh!

865
00:43:47,067 --> 00:43:48,867
(SCREAMING)

866
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,133
(MAY LAUGHS)

867
00:43:54,167 --> 00:43:57,600
-He's up the bank.
-(HORN HONKS)

868
00:43:57,633 --> 00:44:00,600
I think we might have
lost sight of the rules
of this race slightly.

869
00:44:02,067 --> 00:44:05,067
MAY:  The producers had come
to the same conclusion.

870
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:09,333
So we were told to
abandon the oval test track.

871
00:44:09,367 --> 00:44:11,700
And report to the drag strip.

872
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:15,667
Where we would see which car
could get from nought to 60

873
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:20,500
and then back to nought again
in the shortest
possible distance.

874
00:44:21,133 --> 00:44:23,233
-It's a good test, this.
-Yeah.

875
00:44:23,267 --> 00:44:26,733
It is, 'cause it
measures acceleration
and braking all in one go.

876
00:44:26,767 --> 00:44:28,300
Absolutely.

877
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:30,933
MAY:  Leisure Stig went first
to lay down a benchmark.

878
00:44:30,967 --> 00:44:35,567
And as he was mid-run,
Jeremy noticed something.

879
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,667
If you don't stop in time...
(CLEARS THROAT)

880
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,533
Then your day
suddenly gets a lot worse.

881
00:44:40,567 --> 00:44:42,833
CLARKSON: Wetter.
HAMMOND: Colder.

882
00:44:42,867 --> 00:44:44,400
MAY:  Luckily for leisure Stig,

883
00:44:44,433 --> 00:44:47,833
the Kia Sportage stopped
well short of the pond.

884
00:44:47,867 --> 00:44:50,300
And once this
point had been marked,

885
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:53,700
Hammond took his
position on the start line.

886
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:56,267
I think he's had a bit
of a hair transplant.

887
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,800
Just look at his fringe.

888
00:44:57,833 --> 00:45:00,633
Seriously, look at his fringe
when he gets out.

889
00:45:00,667 --> 00:45:02,400
You don't have your fringe
transplanted, do you?

890
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:06,167
Just, well, remember Rooney,
when he had that
forestation job done?

891
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,633
You have a look.

892
00:45:07,667 --> 00:45:09,900
Okay. There's no
putting this off. Here we go.

893
00:45:12,767 --> 00:45:14,633
Come on, everything
you've got, Jeepie,

894
00:45:14,667 --> 00:45:16,567
I need you to
get to 60, quick.

895
00:45:18,467 --> 00:45:20,233
Forty.

896
00:45:20,967 --> 00:45:23,733
Oh, my God. I'm coming up
to the Stig's braking point...

897
00:45:24,933 --> 00:45:26,067
Oh, my God.

898
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,867
On the brakes,
that's all I've got.

899
00:45:28,233 --> 00:45:29,933
That's all I've got.

900
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,633
I can't brake any
harder than that.

901
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:37,633
(LAUGHS)

902
00:45:39,733 --> 00:45:42,467
Did a bit of
excrement come out?

903
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,567
I had to use all of
the brakes, I mean...

904
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,233
And you haven't
actually started braking

905
00:45:48,267 --> 00:45:49,933
before you got to
the Stig's stop sign?

906
00:45:49,967 --> 00:45:51,633
No.

907
00:45:51,667 --> 00:45:53,467
CLARKSON:  That was
a bit of a worry,

908
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:57,467
as Hammond's
Jeep was much faster
than my wounded Vauxhall.

909
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,667
Here we go!

910
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:04,933
Yes! It's a flying
start from Luton's finest.

911
00:46:04,967 --> 00:46:06,733
Five thousand rpm.

912
00:46:07,067 --> 00:46:08,833
Five-and-a-half.

913
00:46:09,133 --> 00:46:10,433
Looking good.

914
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:12,167
There's the Stig's marker.

915
00:46:12,833 --> 00:46:14,500
And there's 60.

916
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,867
(HAMMOND LAUGHS)

917
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,300
Wow!

918
00:46:22,333 --> 00:46:25,600
Holy mother of God,
that was close!

919
00:46:25,633 --> 00:46:27,367
Oh, no.

920
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,967
Do not pretend
you've got clean pants,
because I know you haven't.

921
00:46:30,067 --> 00:46:34,067
Many poos shot out of my ani.

922
00:46:34,067 --> 00:46:36,933
CLARKSON:  I didn't enjoy
my near-death experience,

923
00:46:36,967 --> 00:46:41,233
but in truth,
James enjoyed it even less.

924
00:46:41,267 --> 00:46:44,467
My car is
faster than your car.

925
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,300
And its brakes are not bad.

926
00:46:46,333 --> 00:46:47,767
(SNICKERING)

927
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,867
And I very nearly went into
the muddy pool of effluent.

928
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,433
Didn't you?

929
00:46:52,467 --> 00:46:55,767
-My car's very light.
-Yeah?

930
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,833
MAY:  Still clutching
at straws, I began my run.

931
00:46:59,633 --> 00:47:01,400
Here we go.

932
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,133
It is a test of acceleration.

933
00:47:04,167 --> 00:47:06,067
And braking, and he has
neither of those things.

934
00:47:06,067 --> 00:47:07,733
No, he doesn't.

935
00:47:09,067 --> 00:47:10,733
Come on.

936
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,967
Still accelerating.

937
00:47:16,433 --> 00:47:18,200
Thirty.

938
00:47:18,233 --> 00:47:19,933
Thirty-five.

939
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,800
Still accelerating.

940
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,600
Forty-five.

941
00:47:25,633 --> 00:47:27,733
Well, he can't get to 60,
can he?

942
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:30,867
Fifty.

943
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,600
Fifty-two.

944
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:34,700
Ugh!

-(CLARKSON LAUGHS)

947
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,633
-HAMMOND: Oh, it's sinking.
-You know what he was?

948
00:47:40,667 --> 00:47:42,833
-He was committed.
-Well, yes.

949
00:47:42,867 --> 00:47:45,167
He was determined to reach 60.

950
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,900
He didn't, did he?

951
00:47:47,833 --> 00:47:49,700
God, it's chuffing freezing.

952
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:51,133
You went a bit far.

953
00:47:51,167 --> 00:47:53,433
Can we just get a flag
to mark his position?

954
00:47:53,467 --> 00:47:55,933
Don't just stand there,
you idiots, it's filling up.

955
00:47:55,967 --> 00:47:58,233
CLARKSON: James,
I've looked at the situation.

956
00:47:58,267 --> 00:48:00,800
And there's nothing we can do.

957
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:04,467
So with that,
back to the studio.

958
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,900
HAMMOND:  Except, it wasn't
back to the studio.

959
00:48:07,933 --> 00:48:11,600
Because we were then told
to modify our SUVs

960
00:48:11,633 --> 00:48:13,567
to make them more lifestyle-y.

961
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:17,267
And then report to a car park.

962
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:23,200
A few days later,
with our work completed,
I was the first to arrive.

963
00:48:31,833 --> 00:48:34,533
I mean, hello. Here it is.

964
00:48:34,567 --> 00:48:36,300
What I've done is bring out

965
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:40,967
the Jeep's innate,
outdoorsy American feel.

966
00:48:41,067 --> 00:48:42,633
Up there, roof tent,

967
00:48:42,667 --> 00:48:44,300
which is the best
thing in the whole world.

968
00:48:44,333 --> 00:48:46,333
Winch, dinghy, wind surfer,

969
00:48:46,367 --> 00:48:50,400
pretty much everything I need
to lead the perfect life.

970
00:48:50,433 --> 00:48:53,500
At this point,
Tubs Clarkson arrived.

971
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:06,433
Wow!

972
00:49:06,467 --> 00:49:08,800
I'm not going to tell him,
but that looks amazing.

973
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:11,067
(LAUGHS)

974
00:49:11,067 --> 00:49:13,867
That looks stupid and
you didn't fix the exhaust.

975
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:19,333
Erm, you know the Vauxhall
badge isn't particularly
lifestyle-y.

976
00:49:19,367 --> 00:49:23,067
This is now a Pershing
sports fishing boat.

977
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:27,333
Very naval, fishing rods,
it's registered in the BVI.

978
00:49:27,367 --> 00:49:29,200
-Is that an office chair?
-Yes, it is.

979
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:31,133
-Can you fish on land?
-No.

980
00:49:31,167 --> 00:49:32,733
-Do the aerials work?
-No.

981
00:49:32,767 --> 00:49:34,967
-Can it go in the water?
-No, but it doesn't...

982
00:49:35,067 --> 00:49:36,467
-What have you done?
-Oh!

983
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,533
Just standing here
criticising mine.

984
00:49:38,567 --> 00:49:40,367
Well, let me start
at the front.

985
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:42,700
-If I shoot a deer,
it goes on there.
-Okay.

986
00:49:42,733 --> 00:49:44,700
-Have you got a gun with it?
-No.

987
00:49:44,733 --> 00:49:46,100
So what are you going
to shoot the deer with?

988
00:49:46,133 --> 00:49:48,167
Throw rocks.

989
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:52,300
CLARKSON:  Whilst Hammond
was demonstrating
his rear-mounted barbeque,

990
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:54,967
our underachieving
colleague arrived.

991
00:49:56,233 --> 00:49:58,733
So he's just
done nothing at all.

992
00:49:58,767 --> 00:50:00,900
And then emptied
a skip onto the roof.

993
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,600
-Flamboyant.
-That was the hand brake.

994
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:04,533
(BOTH LAUGHING)

995
00:50:04,567 --> 00:50:06,833
-Nothing works.
-It didn't work.

996
00:50:06,867 --> 00:50:08,467
-Bit of warm-up, was that?
-Yeah.

997
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,000
CLARKSON: Oh, you've written
"Turboactive" on it.

998
00:50:11,033 --> 00:50:14,067
Yes. These are very good
words, "Turbo" and "Active".

999
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:16,200
So I combined them
to make "Turboactive".

1000
00:50:16,233 --> 00:50:18,133
-Is it turbocharged?
-No.

1001
00:50:18,167 --> 00:50:19,533
It's not referring to the car,

1002
00:50:19,567 --> 00:50:21,200
it's referring
to the lifestyle.

1003
00:50:21,233 --> 00:50:22,900
What I've done is,
I've anointed the car

1004
00:50:22,933 --> 00:50:27,100
with every conceivable
leisure activity
piece of equipment.

1005
00:50:27,133 --> 00:50:29,367
Name a leisure activity,
it's here.

1006
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,500
But look at this. You've done
your leisure activities,
whatever those are,

1007
00:50:32,533 --> 00:50:34,800
and then you work up a sweat.

1008
00:50:34,833 --> 00:50:36,600
So you go.

1009
00:50:36,933 --> 00:50:38,933
What do you think? And then...

1010
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,233
But everyone
will see your bits.

1011
00:50:42,267 --> 00:50:43,967
No, you've got a curtain.
Look.

1012
00:50:44,767 --> 00:50:45,900
-Want to try it?
-No.

1013
00:50:45,933 --> 00:50:48,133
What's your seat
upholstery made from?

1014
00:50:48,167 --> 00:50:49,833
-Wetsuits.
-What?

1015
00:50:49,867 --> 00:50:51,667
Old wetsuits.

1016
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,433
If, for example,
you drove in, you know,
your car went into some water.

1017
00:50:54,467 --> 00:50:56,167
-Which does happen.
-Yeah, it does happen.

1018
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:57,800
The seats aren't ruined.

1019
00:50:57,833 --> 00:51:01,167
There's one feature
I want to show you
on my car, if I may.

1020
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,333
Obviously, I've built
a sport fishing boat.

1021
00:51:04,367 --> 00:51:06,933
But I've equipped it
with some excellent wheels.

1022
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,900
Oh, my God.

1023
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:14,200
Don't you think they're
the cleverest wheels you've
ever seen?

1024
00:51:14,233 --> 00:51:16,067
No. I think
they're really terrible.

1025
00:51:16,067 --> 00:51:17,533
What's the matter with them?

1026
00:51:17,567 --> 00:51:20,900
HAMMOND: Yes, certainly,
Reverend, I'll give you
a lift. Hop in.

1027
00:51:20,933 --> 00:51:23,700
CLARKSON:  Proud of our
leisure lifestyle vehicles,

1028
00:51:23,733 --> 00:51:27,267
we decided to go and do
some leisure lifestyle.

1029
00:51:32,567 --> 00:51:34,700
CLARKSON: People are no longer
looking at this saying,

1030
00:51:34,733 --> 00:51:37,800
"Look, there's a man
in a 140-pound Vauxhall."

1031
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:42,400
They're now saying,
"Look, there's the hero
from a Wilbur Smith book.

1032
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:46,500
"The man whose back ripples
like a sack of pythons."

1033
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,533
I'm wondering
what sort of a man

1034
00:51:50,567 --> 00:51:52,267
would want to
buy Hammond's car

1035
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,733
and I'm thinking
it's the sort of man

1036
00:51:54,767 --> 00:51:57,400
whose IQ begins
with a decimal point.

1037
00:51:59,067 --> 00:52:01,600
I could drive off there now
into those woods.

1038
00:52:01,633 --> 00:52:04,300
I've got a tent.
I've got a home on the roof.

1039
00:52:04,333 --> 00:52:06,133
I can hide
from bears up there.

1040
00:52:06,167 --> 00:52:09,900
I could cook
a bear on my barbeque
or carry a bear on my bonnet.

1041
00:52:09,933 --> 00:52:14,200
I could probably survive
for weeks, months, years
with this car,

1042
00:52:14,233 --> 00:52:16,633
out there in the wilderness.

1043
00:52:20,533 --> 00:52:22,067
MAY: That man's taken
a photograph of us.

1044
00:52:22,067 --> 00:52:23,733
He's going to show it
to his friends tonight
and say,

1045
00:52:23,767 --> 00:52:28,233
"Look what I saw.
Some utterly (BLEEP) cars."

1046
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,833
CLARKSON:  Soon we arrived at
a cold British pond,

1047
00:52:33,867 --> 00:52:38,533
and immediately
took to the water
in some leisure craft.

1048
00:52:38,567 --> 00:52:40,800
James May is doing leisure!

1049
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:42,733
Hey, this is leisurely!

1050
00:52:42,767 --> 00:52:44,333
CLARKSON:
But, as it turned out,

1051
00:52:44,367 --> 00:52:47,300
doing leisure proved
to be quite stressful.

1052
00:52:48,067 --> 00:52:51,067
No, no, no, no, other way.

1053
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:52,767
Other way, you (BLEEP)!

1054
00:52:53,733 --> 00:52:55,333
Jesus wept!

1055
00:52:55,367 --> 00:52:57,633
Hammond, I'm going a million!

1056
00:52:57,667 --> 00:53:00,533
I don't like it!

1057
00:53:00,567 --> 00:53:04,067
This stupid thing's
got a mind... Ow!
...of its own!

1058
00:53:04,467 --> 00:53:05,800
(GROANS)

1059
00:53:05,833 --> 00:53:07,533
Still, could be worse.

1060
00:53:08,733 --> 00:53:10,433
No.

1061
00:53:12,433 --> 00:53:13,933
No.

1062
00:53:13,967 --> 00:53:15,667
Oh!

1063
00:53:18,667 --> 00:53:20,200
No.

1064
00:53:20,233 --> 00:53:23,433
CLARKSON:  As I fought off
attacks from my Hobie Cat...

1065
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:25,167
No!

1066
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,633
I noticed something.

1067
00:53:26,667 --> 00:53:30,167
Hey, look.
That's one of the producers.

1068
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,600
Has he got a gold...
He's got a gold envelope,
look.

1069
00:53:33,633 --> 00:53:36,867
And since I was the only one
who was moving,

1070
00:53:39,067 --> 00:53:41,067
I went to see what was what.

1071
00:53:41,067 --> 00:53:45,067
Thomas Crown Affair's going in
and going in hard!

1072
00:53:45,067 --> 00:53:47,300
HAMMOND: Now it's going all
choppy and that's worse.

1073
00:53:47,333 --> 00:53:48,800
I hate this!

1074
00:53:48,833 --> 00:53:50,900
-Guys!
-BOTH: What?

1075
00:53:50,933 --> 00:53:52,633
There's a challenge.

1076
00:53:53,233 --> 00:53:55,267
What is it?

1077
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:58,100
CLARKSON: Many people
who buy sport utility vehicles

1078
00:53:58,133 --> 00:54:03,133
imagine they're more safe
and robust than normal cars.

1079
00:54:03,167 --> 00:54:05,267
You will now find
which one of you

1080
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:08,067
has the safest
and most robust car

1081
00:54:08,067 --> 00:54:10,233
by running them down a cliff.

1082
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:16,400
Annoyingly,
that wasn't a misprint.

1083
00:54:17,933 --> 00:54:19,767
Oh, hang on, look.

1084
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,233
Holy moly!

1085
00:54:26,933 --> 00:54:28,067
(HAMMOND EXCLAIMS)

1086
00:54:28,067 --> 00:54:29,233
MAY: God's teeth.

1087
00:54:29,267 --> 00:54:32,067
-HAMMOND:
That's a drop, isn't it?
-Isn't it.

1088
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:35,167
Can I suggest we should
probably put our seat belts
on for this?

1089
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,167
I was just thinking,
I'd like a harness.

1090
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,433
You know we're not
gonna be in the cars.

1091
00:54:38,467 --> 00:54:39,800
I knew that. Good.

1092
00:54:39,833 --> 00:54:42,733
This is a test of the car's
robustness and safety.

1093
00:54:42,767 --> 00:54:44,700
-Can I just say...
-That's good.
I thought it was death.

1094
00:54:44,733 --> 00:54:47,967
I really like my car
and I don't wanna do
that to it.

1095
00:54:48,067 --> 00:54:50,067
Well, no, this is the thing.

1096
00:54:50,067 --> 00:54:53,067
Working on this programme
is a bit like doing a jigsaw.

1097
00:54:53,067 --> 00:54:56,067
You spend ages and ages
and ages doing something,

1098
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:57,467
you go,
"Yes, that's brilliant,

1099
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,100
"now I'm gonna smash it up
and put it in a box."

1100
00:54:59,133 --> 00:55:00,967
Yeah... Yes, that's
what's happening today,

1101
00:55:01,067 --> 00:55:02,767
'cause I'm really
pleased with that.

1102
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:06,867
HAMMOND:  And sadly,
that was first to go.

1103
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,300
ALL: No, no, no, no! No!

1104
00:55:11,467 --> 00:55:12,867
No, it's fine, it's fine.

1105
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,400
-Is it gonna be okay?
-CLARKSON: It's okay.

1106
00:55:14,433 --> 00:55:16,067
HAMMOND: It's all right.
CLARKSON: It is okay.

1107
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:18,400
MAY: It is all right,
look at that. It's fine.

1108
00:55:18,433 --> 00:55:20,133
CLARKSON: It's fine,
the wheels are still on,

1109
00:55:20,167 --> 00:55:21,933
which is unusual
for a car of yours.

1110
00:55:23,433 --> 00:55:24,667
It's quite nice to
see the underside.

1111
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:25,867
-It's in good nick, that.
-(CLEARS THROAT)

1112
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:27,633
Look at that cross
member in the chassis.

1113
00:55:27,667 --> 00:55:29,967
You need a new
rear exhaust silencer.

1114
00:55:30,067 --> 00:55:33,667
HAMMOND:  Next, it was
the turn of the Turboactive.

1115
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,567
What if mine hits yours
on the way down?

1116
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,833
You get points
for that, don't you?
Like a snooker thing.

1117
00:55:38,867 --> 00:55:40,100
Here we go, here we go.

1118
00:55:40,133 --> 00:55:42,267
-MAY: No, no!
-(HAMMOND LAUGHS)

1119
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:45,067
MAY: No!
CLARKSON: Oh!

1120
00:55:45,067 --> 00:55:47,067
MAY: No, that's less good.

1121
00:55:47,067 --> 00:55:49,533
HAMMOND: Turns out
that bicycles are a big
safety feature.

1122
00:55:49,567 --> 00:55:51,267
-They are.
-'Cause they
stopped it rolling.

1123
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,467
That's an interesting point.
If you have a bicycle
on the roof...

1124
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:57,467
-You can't roll.
-Better putting it on
the roof than riding it.

1125
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:01,967
CLARKSON:  Finally it was the
turn of the Pershing Frontera.

1126
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:05,767
You can't roll a Frontera.
It's very famous for that.

1127
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,200
I'm not sure,
but I think you may be
about to discover that it can.

1128
00:56:09,233 --> 00:56:10,933
(HAMMOND LAUGHS)

1129
00:56:12,533 --> 00:56:14,733
-There you go.
Oh, it is doing a bit.
-Yeah, it really is.

1130
00:56:14,767 --> 00:56:16,533
Oh, dear.

1131
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,667
-Oh, it... You see...
-It's still going.

1132
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,600
-That's very good.
-HAMMOND: What it's doing
is still rolling.

1133
00:56:20,633 --> 00:56:23,600
MAY: That's dramatic.
And it's gone right off
the edge! Oh!

1134
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:27,800
Mine is the only one
that's completed the journey.

1135
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:29,567
You don't get extra points
for getting

1136
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,333
further down the cliff,
you don't.

1137
00:56:31,367 --> 00:56:37,400
CLARKSON:  Amazingly,
the 140-pound Frontera
still looked like a car.

1138
00:56:37,433 --> 00:56:39,800
And even more amazingly...

1139
00:56:40,733 --> 00:56:42,600
(ENGINE STARTS)

1140
00:56:42,633 --> 00:56:44,333
Yes, here we go.

1141
00:56:46,067 --> 00:56:47,767
-Oh, yeah.
-Excellent.

1142
00:56:49,067 --> 00:56:50,733
That's passed.

1143
00:56:50,767 --> 00:56:52,600
-That is genuinely...
-It's done surprisingly
well, actually.

1144
00:56:52,633 --> 00:56:54,833
That is not bad.

1145
00:56:54,867 --> 00:56:58,300
CLARKSON:  Better still,
it was able to haul
the Jeep off the cliff.

1146
00:56:58,333 --> 00:57:00,667
-Yeah.
-Yes!

1147
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:02,300
There you go.

1148
00:57:02,333 --> 00:57:04,067
I thank you.

1149
00:57:04,100 --> 00:57:09,800
CLARKSON:  But sadly,
James' Turboactive Pinin
was just too far away.

1150
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:12,433
Onwards.

1151
00:57:12,467 --> 00:57:14,467
So we left him behind.

1152
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:23,967
Eventually though,
we were all reunited
in Yorkshire,

1153
00:57:24,067 --> 00:57:28,567
where we'd been told to report
for one final challenge.

1154
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,767
Why are we on a grouse moor
in dinner jackets?

1155
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,167
I've no idea.

1156
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,100
And why are you getting out
of your passenger door?

1157
00:57:35,133 --> 00:57:38,067
Well that side's a bit bent,
I can't open that door.

1158
00:57:38,067 --> 00:57:39,600
You... Oh, hello.

1159
00:57:39,633 --> 00:57:42,833
Now we can discover
why we're dressed like this.

1160
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,733
Right.

1161
00:57:44,767 --> 00:57:48,067
"Now you must test
your car's rough
terrain abilities.

1162
00:57:48,067 --> 00:57:53,300
"Tonight, the North Yorkshire
Carbon Management
and Sustainability Trust

annual conference
and dinner at Broughton Hall,

1165
00:57:59,067 --> 00:58:02,367
"You must drive there
without using any roads."

1166
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,633
Erm, oh, God!

1167
00:58:05,667 --> 00:58:07,100
What?

1168
00:58:07,133 --> 00:58:10,567
The last to arrive will be
doing the after-dinner speech.

1169
00:58:14,167 --> 00:58:16,867
-This matters.
This matters a lot.
-This is bad.

1170
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,300
I'm not losing this.

1171
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:20,433
Where's Broughton Hall?

1172
00:58:20,467 --> 00:58:21,967
This is what I do.

1173
00:58:22,067 --> 00:58:25,200
Maps, countryside, 4X4s.

1174
00:58:25,233 --> 00:58:26,967
That's east.

1175
00:58:28,067 --> 00:58:29,733
There's Broughton Hall.

1176
00:58:34,767 --> 00:58:36,367
Oh, please, God, no.

1177
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,367
I hate after-dinner speaking.

1178
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,400
I hate it with such a passion.

1179
00:58:43,467 --> 00:58:45,067
I have done a couple of
after-dinner speeches.

1180
00:58:45,067 --> 00:58:46,467
On both occasions I thought,

1181
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,433
"I'm gonna be brilliant,
I'm gonna knock 'em dead."

1182
00:58:48,467 --> 00:58:51,867
On both occasions
I died on my arse.

1183
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:55,367
MAY:  I too trembled
at the thought of
after-dinner speaking,

1184
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,400
and I had another issue.

1185
00:58:58,433 --> 00:59:00,867
I know I'm out of my
element here, viewers.

1186
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:04,667
I live in Hammersmith.
This is the countryside,
I don't really like it.

1187
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:07,633
Don't know what it's for
or what you're
supposed to do with it.

1188
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,167
Okay, sit rep.

1189
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:16,367
The roll down the bank
has caused
a little bit of damage.

1190
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,833
The windscreen and side window
are both now plastic,

1191
00:59:19,867 --> 00:59:25,867
but the mighty
Vauxhall Vectra engine
is working well.

1192
00:59:27,167 --> 00:59:30,167
Come on, grippy penis wheels.

1193
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,800
MAY:  In the Pinin,

1194
00:59:31,833 --> 00:59:35,067
my ignorance of country ways
had already got me in bother.

1195
00:59:37,233 --> 00:59:38,833
Hang on a minute.

1196
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:40,567
I'm stuck in a sheep pen.

1197
00:59:43,267 --> 00:59:44,700
You mustn't worry sheep,
I know that,

1198
00:59:44,733 --> 00:59:47,233
otherwise the farmer comes
and shoots at you.

1199
00:59:48,667 --> 00:59:52,300
HAMMOND:  I, meanwhile,
was totally in my element.

1200
00:59:52,633 --> 00:59:54,400
Yes.

1201
00:59:54,833 --> 00:59:56,367
Oh, well done, Jeepie.

1202
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,200
This thing is
actually brilliant off-road.

1203
01:00:00,233 --> 01:00:03,667
Minimal revs,
just let the torque do it.

1204
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,567
This is where Jeremy's
gonna go horribly wrong.

1205
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,900
Power is not
necessarily the solution here.

1206
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:13,267
CLARKSON: Power!

1207
01:00:15,367 --> 01:00:16,900
Come on, speed!

1208
01:00:16,933 --> 01:00:18,633
Oh, dear, no.

1209
01:00:20,467 --> 01:00:23,000
And that's... Oh, come on!

1210
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:26,567
Now I'm in very
big trouble here.

1211
01:00:28,933 --> 01:00:30,700
Ladies and gentlemen!

1212
01:00:30,733 --> 01:00:34,100
I'm not saying
my mother-in-law's fat,

1213
01:00:34,133 --> 01:00:36,500
but she is sustainable.

1214
01:00:36,533 --> 01:00:39,500
I can't do
after-dinner speaking!

1215
01:00:40,733 --> 01:00:42,433
(GROANS IN DISGUST)

1216
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,000
Cocking Nora,
I'm in another pen.

1217
01:00:54,033 --> 01:00:56,733
I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life
in a pen full of sheep.

1218
01:00:57,967 --> 01:00:59,667
Gate, that's a gate.

1219
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,467
Bollocks!

1220
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:08,233
CLARKSON:  Having been
pulled free by a friendly
country type...

1221
01:01:08,267 --> 01:01:10,800
Yes, yes.

1222
01:01:11,733 --> 01:01:13,600
I set off again,

1223
01:01:13,633 --> 01:01:16,333
having not learned my lesson.

1224
01:01:16,367 --> 01:01:18,067
Speed through the muddy bit.

1225
01:01:20,933 --> 01:01:23,433
No, no, no, no, this is bad!

1226
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,433
(SCREAMS)

1227
01:01:29,333 --> 01:01:32,233
I've gone in a tree.
A tree is happening.

1228
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:35,067
Still, could be worse.

1229
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:37,433
Don't touch the brakes.
I can't help it,
I'm touching the brake.

1230
01:01:37,833 --> 01:01:39,667
Oh!

1231
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,100
Ow! Oh!

1232
01:01:41,133 --> 01:01:42,833
No, I can't stop now.

1233
01:01:42,867 --> 01:01:44,633
Oh!

1234
01:01:45,233 --> 01:01:48,567
Oh, don't go down there,
don't go down there.

1235
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,500
Not good.

1236
01:01:52,067 --> 01:01:53,133
Ha-ha!

1237
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:54,867
There you go.

1238
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,900
Yes.

1239
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,067
Oh, yeah.

1240
01:02:01,367 --> 01:02:04,300
Yeah! Ha-ha!

1241
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:07,233
CLARKSON:  All three of us
had been on the move
for two hours

1242
01:02:07,267 --> 01:02:10,900
and none of us was
much closer to
our destination.

1243
01:02:10,933 --> 01:02:15,200
However, I'd managed to find
a promising-looking track.

1244
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:18,300
It doesn't go all
the way to the hall

1245
01:02:18,333 --> 01:02:22,233
but it will get
me a mile or so.

1246
01:02:22,267 --> 01:02:27,233
Tonight, ladies and gentlemen,
your guest speaker
is James May.

1247
01:02:27,733 --> 01:02:29,067
Speed!

1248
01:02:29,067 --> 01:02:30,900
Power. Blind!

1249
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,267
Wait, yes, that's...

1250
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:35,800
That's it, that's the...
It's all over now.

1251
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:40,233
Meanwhile,
back in the sheep pens.

1252
01:02:42,067 --> 01:02:43,867
MAY: I've already been here.

1253
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:49,067
CLARKSON:  Having solved my
visibility issues...

1254
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:53,067
Yes, behold
the strength of the man.

1255
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:55,267
I was back on the move.

1256
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,267
Oh, God, it's cold.

1257
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:05,767
I'm 54, why am I doing this?

1258
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,067
Ah!

1259
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:11,833
Don't want that.

1260
01:03:13,133 --> 01:03:17,833
HAMMOND:  In the Jeep,
my countryside
skills had paid off.

1261
01:03:17,867 --> 01:03:19,300
Hang on a minute.

1262
01:03:19,333 --> 01:03:21,067
That's it.

1263
01:03:21,067 --> 01:03:22,967
That's where I'm going.

1264
01:03:24,633 --> 01:03:26,067
This is it.

1265
01:03:26,067 --> 01:03:27,433
There it is.

1266
01:03:27,467 --> 01:03:29,767
Ladies and gentlemen,
your speaker for this evening

1267
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:32,900
will not be Richard Hammond
because he won the race.

1268
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:37,233
(GRUNTS)

1269
01:03:37,867 --> 01:03:39,567
Oh, yeah.

1270
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:50,067
Wrong place. Oh, God!

1271
01:03:50,067 --> 01:03:53,433
CLARKSON:  I, meanwhile,
wasn't at the wrong place.

1272
01:03:55,900 --> 01:04:00,333
And there it is,
Broughton Hall.
My quest is at an end.

1273
01:04:02,267 --> 01:04:06,200
There's a bridge
across the river.
Excellent news!

1274
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:14,500
Oh, no.

1275
01:04:17,133 --> 01:04:19,900
Yes, look,
in here, there's an exit.

1276
01:04:19,933 --> 01:04:22,933
That's what it's for,
look, that's what it's for.

1277
01:04:22,967 --> 01:04:27,400
That's a ford, in my mind.

1278
01:04:27,433 --> 01:04:33,400
Having waterproofed my car
for the perilous river
crossing, I waded in.

1279
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,067
Yes.

1280
01:04:37,067 --> 01:04:40,833
I have designed
this to be a boat
and it's going to be one.

1281
01:04:51,067 --> 01:04:52,733
Argh!

1282
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:58,067
Please don't do that.

1283
01:05:01,733 --> 01:05:05,667
Meanwhile,
James was still stuck
in a sheep pen.

1284
01:05:06,933 --> 01:05:08,167
Really stuck.

1285
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,067
MAY: No, no, no, no, no!

1286
01:05:12,267 --> 01:05:14,333
Right,
hang on, hang on, hang on.

1287
01:05:15,133 --> 01:05:16,833
I can do...

1288
01:05:16,867 --> 01:05:18,567
(BLEEP)

1289
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:20,800
(BLEEP)

1290
01:05:25,067 --> 01:05:28,400
CLARKSON:  Up at the hall,
the guests were
starting to arrive.

1291
01:05:37,567 --> 01:05:39,267
(SIGHS) Let's just try that.

1292
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:41,067
(BLEEP) hell.

1293
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,933
Sure, that was
the bit of the map I needed.

1294
01:05:48,967 --> 01:05:50,667
It's slippery.

1295
01:05:54,333 --> 01:05:56,233
This is the right way.

1296
01:05:56,267 --> 01:05:57,800
I think this is the right way.

1297
01:05:57,833 --> 01:05:59,800
I don't wanna have
to do the speech.

1298
01:05:59,833 --> 01:06:01,367
I don't wanna do the speech.

1299
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:05,167
What was it again?
Sustainability and
carbon something?

1300
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:08,067
I mean,
they're not gonna wanna hear
about my Mustang, are they?

1301
01:06:18,233 --> 01:06:20,067
CLARKSON: No!

1302
01:06:20,067 --> 01:06:24,100
In the Frontera, things
still weren't going well.

1303
01:06:24,133 --> 01:06:25,733
You bastard!

1304
01:06:25,767 --> 01:06:29,267
But I had at least
found a way to stay warm.

1305
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:36,067
Oh, yeah.

1306
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:38,967
I can't imagine that
a urine-soaked
pair of trousers

1307
01:06:39,067 --> 01:06:42,233
is going to put
the audience off,
because look...

1308
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:47,567
Meanwhile,
a long way downstream.

1309
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:48,967
HAMMOND: Oh!

1310
01:06:49,067 --> 01:06:51,333
That's deeper than I expected.

1311
01:06:55,867 --> 01:06:57,567
Yeah!

1312
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:02,700
Oh, no.

1313
01:07:02,733 --> 01:07:04,500
Go ahead and kill me.

1314
01:07:04,867 --> 01:07:06,567
Just kill me.

1315
01:07:07,067 --> 01:07:09,267
Bad! Bad!

1316
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:12,800
Deep... Deep mud!

1317
01:07:12,833 --> 01:07:14,433
Oh, God, I've lost a shoe!

1318
01:07:14,467 --> 01:07:15,633
Oh, no!

1319
01:07:15,667 --> 01:07:17,367
No shoe. Cold...

1320
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:22,167
No, no, no. Oh, God!

1321
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,200
With Jeremy
and I bogged down...

1322
01:07:24,233 --> 01:07:25,367
No!

1323
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:27,233
...James was on
the move again,

1324
01:07:27,267 --> 01:07:30,233
and bringing
himself into contention.

1325
01:07:32,933 --> 01:07:34,533
Oh, yes.

1326
01:07:34,567 --> 01:07:37,967
This farm track is
the most beautiful road
I've ever seen.

1327
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:42,267
I might get out of this yet.

1328
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,700
-Come on! No, don't!
-(WHIRRING)

1329
01:07:55,267 --> 01:07:57,767
I hate working on  Top Gear!

1330
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:03,933
HAMMOND:  In the Jeep,
I was finally free

1331
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:05,833
and back in the running.

1332
01:08:05,867 --> 01:08:07,400
It's not over yet.

1333
01:08:07,433 --> 01:08:10,567
Gonna go just over this crest
and there it will be.

1334
01:08:12,067 --> 01:08:14,633
Buffeting. Buffeting.

1335
01:08:14,667 --> 01:08:17,533
Ladies and gentlemen,
your host for this evening,

1336
01:08:17,567 --> 01:08:19,267
from BBC's  Top Gear,

1337
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:21,633
it's Richard
Hammond/Jeremy Clarkson.

1338
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:26,300
CLARKSON:  Not if I had
anything to do with it.

1339
01:08:27,933 --> 01:08:29,867
Come on, Vauxhall!

1340
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:32,400
Come on, 140-pound Vauxhall...

1341
01:08:32,433 --> 01:08:34,133
Well, 70-pound Vauxhall now.

1342
01:08:38,433 --> 01:08:40,733
Engine warning lights are on.

1343
01:08:40,767 --> 01:08:43,600
It doesn't have to live for
more than another
10 minutes or so.

1344
01:08:43,633 --> 01:08:47,433
It just has to get me there
before one of the other two.

1345
01:08:47,467 --> 01:08:49,167
Please!

1346
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,467
Move!

1347
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,200
Yeah!

1348
01:08:56,133 --> 01:08:58,900
Not now, not so close!

1349
01:09:01,067 --> 01:09:04,367
Please!

1350
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,400
I beg of you! Mercy!

1351
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:12,367
Come on, little car,
you've got about
half a mile to go.

1352
01:09:13,533 --> 01:09:15,733
Come on, come on, keep moving.

1353
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,767
Here I am. I've made
it to Broughton Hall.

1354
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:24,933
Is James here,
is Richard here?

1355
01:09:26,200 --> 01:09:28,200
I can't see their cars.

1356
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:31,533
Come on! Yes!

1357
01:09:33,233 --> 01:09:36,333
Thank you, Lord!
Thank you, Vauxhall!

1358
01:09:40,567 --> 01:09:42,933
Oh, God, I'm gonna end up
doing the speech!

1359
01:09:43,467 --> 01:09:45,167
Oh, yes!

1360
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:48,833
That is, ladies and gentlemen,
the home straight.

1361
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:52,533
This is it, there it is.

1362
01:09:55,167 --> 01:09:57,600
Please, please, please.

1363
01:10:06,167 --> 01:10:08,700
MAN:  Ladies and gentlemen,

1364
01:10:08,733 --> 01:10:10,167
I'm sorry about
the wait this evening.

1365
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:13,033
Thank you so much
for your patience.

1366
01:10:13,067 --> 01:10:14,567
It gives me great pleasure,

1367
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:17,000
your guest speaker tonight is

1368
01:10:17,933 --> 01:10:19,733
Mr Richard Hammond.

1369
01:10:19,767 --> 01:10:21,467
(APPLAUSE)

1370
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:35,500
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1371
01:10:35,533 --> 01:10:38,567
Carbon Management
and Sustainability Trust.

1372
01:10:42,867 --> 01:10:45,100
I am often asked,

1373
01:10:45,133 --> 01:10:47,700
what's your
favourite car, Richard?

1374
01:10:47,733 --> 01:10:49,433
And it's a Land Rover.

1375
01:10:51,633 --> 01:10:55,067
But that, you see,
land, because you...

1376
01:10:55,100 --> 01:11:00,567
It's primarily the environment
with which you are involved,

1377
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,967
I'm actually wearing

1378
01:11:02,067 --> 01:11:03,733
quite a lot of
the environment this evening.

1379
01:11:06,833 --> 01:11:08,533
Erm...

1380
01:11:13,133 --> 01:11:14,833
Isn't Jeremy fat?

1381
01:11:17,333 --> 01:11:18,800
Sorry, sir, I don't mean...

1382
01:11:18,833 --> 01:11:21,800
That's not
necessarily bad, obviously.

1383
01:11:21,833 --> 01:11:23,667
Some people just are.

1384
01:11:26,367 --> 01:11:27,633
MAY: Well, you know what?

1385
01:11:27,667 --> 01:11:29,433
Actually,
that sounded like one of

1386
01:11:29,467 --> 01:11:31,133
your more successful
after-dinner speeches.

1387
01:11:31,167 --> 01:11:32,467
Do you know, it was?

1388
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,600
Nobody even threw crockery
for another minute.

1389
01:11:34,633 --> 01:11:36,633
Anyway, we hope
you enjoyed those films

1390
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:40,367
and all that remains now
is for us to say
thank you for watching.

1391
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:43,733
Yes, absolutely, thank you
very much for watching,

1392
01:11:43,767 --> 01:11:47,067
-and, well, goodbye.
-Goodbye.
