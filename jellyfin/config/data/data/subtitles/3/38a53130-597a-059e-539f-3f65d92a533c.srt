1
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,240
<font size="36">And every other day, I take
a short helicopter ride</font>

2
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,120
<font size="36">to Heston Blumenthal's restaurant.</font>

3
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,840
<font size="36">Last night,</font>

4
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,960
<font size="36">I ate a chocolate radio
that still worked in my stomach,</font>

5
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,280
<font size="36">and a flat chicken
that was actually a glass of water.</font>

6
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,880
<font size="36">Even the menu was edible.</font>

7
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,080
<font size="36">They said it wasn't, but I ate it.</font>

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,800
<font size="36">Sounds like
you're living the life of Riley.</font>

9
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,040
<font size="36">Well, I actually knew Riley,
and yes, there are similarities.</font>

10
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,920
<font size="36">And yet, there is some sadness in
your life. Tell me about Victoria.</font>

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,200
<font size="36">You'll have to forgive me,
there's been quite a few Victorias.</font>

12
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,480
<font size="36">Your wife?</font>

13
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,960
<font size="36">Oh!
My God, my wife, oh yes, Victoria!</font>

14
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,120
<font size="36">What a fantastic woman. The two weeks
we were married were unforgettable.</font>

15
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,440
<font size="36">She disappeared in mysterious
circumstances, did she not?</font>

16
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,280
<font size="36">She vanished while washing the car.</font>

17
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,000
<font size="36">Despite a search that lasted nearly
five hours, we found nothing.</font>

18
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,960
<font size="36">So naturally, we assumed the worst.
You must miss her.</font>

19
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,720
<font size="36">(TREMULOUS VOICE)
More than words could say.</font>

20
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,160
<font size="36">I'd give anything to see her
walk through that door right now.</font>

21
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,440
<font size="36">Hey, why don't you
take your clothes off?</font>

22
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,920
<font size="36">What?</font>

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,680
<font size="36">Come on, we both knew it was on
the cards as soon as I realised you
were a woman!</font>

24
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,600
<font size="36">What if someone were to walk in?</font>

25
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,840
<font size="36">I left strict instructions not to
be disturbed in case we had sex.</font>

26
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,840
<font size="36">There's no way anyone is
walking through that door...</font>

27
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,320
<font size="36">Hello, Douglas.</font>

28
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,680
<font size="36">Victoria!</font>

29
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,760
<font size="36">But I thought you were dead!</font>

30
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,640
<font size="36">I must say, Douglas, you still
don't seem very pleased to see me.</font>

31
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,640
<font size="36">No, no, I must have eaten
some bad stereo system.</font>

32
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,920
<font size="36">How's the wine?</font>

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,280
<font size="36">Exquisite.</font>

34
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,840
<font size="36">From the chef's own cellar.</font>

35
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,680
<font size="36">What are you doing, Victoria? Last
time I saw you, you were...</font>

36
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,720
<font size="36">Washing the car? Yes, I imagine
you have many questions.</font>

37
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,480
<font size="36">I was under a lot of stress that
day, Douglas. I think we both were.</font>

38
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,080
<font size="36">We both knew it wasn't working.</font>

39
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,200
<font size="36">I picked up my sponge and bucket
with a heavy heart that day.</font>

40
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,280
<font size="36">The rest is a blank. The next thing
I can remember with any clarity</font>

41
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,120
<font size="36">is being on a kayaking holiday
two years later.</font>

42
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,640
<font size="36">That looks good, what's that?</font>

43
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,920
<font size="36">I sort of wish I'd ordered that.</font>

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,640
<font size="36">Our invisible desserts have arrived!</font>

45
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,440
<font size="36">I know we weren't happy that second
week of our marriage, Douglas,</font>

46
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,680
<font size="36">but give us another chance,
as a couple.</font>

47
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,960
<font size="36">I don't know.</font>

48
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,720
<font size="36">I don't think we can just pick up
from where we left off.</font>

49
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,000
<font size="36">No, Victoria, I'm sorry, it's over.</font>

50
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,000
<font size="36">UNZIPPING</font>

51
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,720
<font size="36">Oh God!</font>

52
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,560
<font size="36">I forgot you could do that.</font>

53
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,040
<font size="36">Maybe we should give it another go!</font>

54
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,760
<font size="36">Nnngh...</font>

55
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,360
<font size="36">Well that is new!</font>

56
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,440
<font size="36">How are you doing that?</font>

57
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,880
<font size="36">That might be the dog.</font>

58
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,360
<font size="36">Heston!</font>

59
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,480
<font size="36">I'd like to introduce you to my...</font>

60
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,040
<font size="36">wi-i-i-ife.</font>

61
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,560
<font size="36">I want to divorce my wife.</font>

62
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,080
<font size="36">Why are you telling me?</font>

63
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,640
<font size="36">Aren't you with legal?</font>

64
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,560
<font size="36">No.</font>

65
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,920
<font size="36">Remind me?</font>

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,720
<font size="36">IT. Relationship manager.</font>

67
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,240
<font size="36">Ah. Well then I probably
shouldn't have told you any of that.</font>

68
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,880
<font size="36">Anyway...</font>

69
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,280
<font size="36">I want to divorce her right now.</font>

70
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,680
<font size="36">Now's too late. Before now.</font>

71
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,800
<font size="36">In fact, I want to have already
divorced her, is that possible?</font>

72
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,360
<font size="36">Well, as I said,
I'm not a lawyer, so...</font>

73
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:18,480
<font size="36">Yes, but you're a relationship
manager, and this is a relationship!</font>

74
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,080
<font size="36">Well, erm...</font>

75
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,520
<font size="36">have you told her yet?</font>

76
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,080
<font size="36">Kind of. I changed my Friendface
profile from "married"</font>

77
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,680
<font size="36">to "it's complicated".</font>

78
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,680
<font size="36">That's not the same as
telling her, Mr Reynholm.</font>

79
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,520
<font size="36">Yeah, but someone will pass it on.
Why not you?</font>

80
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,400
<font size="36">No!</font>

81
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,840
<font size="36">Oh come on! Please break up with</font>

82
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,760
<font size="36">my vanishing, car cleaning wife!
I don't want to do it!</font>

83
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,280
<font size="36">I don't want to do it!</font>

84
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,080
<font size="36">I'll give you...I don't know...</font>

85
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,440
<font size="36">Who are you again?</font>

86
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,280
<font size="36">I'm Jen Barber.</font>

87
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,400
<font size="36">I'm with the IT department
at Reynholm Industries.</font>

88
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,640
<font size="36">Sorry, I thought
I was meeting my husband.</font>

89
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:05,280
<font size="36">Er...Mr Reynholm asked me to
convey a, um, a message to you.</font>

90
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,600
<font size="36">Mrs Reynholm.</font>

91
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,320
<font size="36">How long have you and Mr Reynholm
known each other?</font>

92
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,400
<font size="36">About ten years.</font>

93
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,760
<font size="36">Ten years, ten wonderful years.</font>

94
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,760
<font size="36">Who are you?</font>

95
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,600
<font size="36">Mrs Reynholm...
Can I call you Victoria?</font>

96
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,120
<font size="36">No.</font>

97
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,480
<font size="36">Mrs Reynholm.</font>

98
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,000
<font size="36">Sometimes there is a day and
then there is a night.</font>

99
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,520
<font size="36">Sometimes there is a morn,</font>

100
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,680
<font size="36">and then there is an eve.</font>

101
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,280
<font size="36">Flowers grow, trees are cut down,</font>

102
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,120
<font size="36">babies are born, but, erm...</font>

103
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,840
<font size="36">lawyers exist.</font>

104
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,960
<font size="36">What are you trying to say?</font>

105
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,680
<font size="36">Oh, I can't do it, I just can't.</font>

106
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,000
<font size="36">Let me guess. My husband wants
to leave me</font>

107
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,360
<font size="36">and he paid you a large amount of
money to spare him the embarrassment
of facing me.</font>

108
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,600
<font size="36">Yes, but I'm not going to
take the money... I feel sick.</font>

109
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,520
<font size="36">Of course you do,
you're a normal person.</font>

110
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,120
<font size="36">You're not upset?</font>

111
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,720
<font size="36">No, because I'm not a normal person.</font>

112
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,200
<font size="36">You see, what you're
trying to do here but can't -</font>

113
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,200
<font size="36">if the tables were turned,
I wouldn't find it difficult at all.</font>

114
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,320
<font size="36">In fact, it's how I
met his first wife.</font>

115
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,640
<font size="36">I didn't know these were edible too.</font>

116
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,960
<font size="36">They're not.</font>

117
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,400
<font size="36">What's all that?</font>

118
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,800
<font size="36">I have to spend the afternoon
with Douglas.</font>

119
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,760
<font size="36">Somehow I've been drafted
into his legal eagle fantasy.</font>

120
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,280
<font size="36">Have you ever spent
any serious time with that man?</font>

121
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,360
<font size="36">He's unbelievable! You should
hear the way he talks about women.</font>

122
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,520
<font size="36">Oh yeah, he's some piece of work.
He's like a sexy Hitler.</font>

123
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,480
<font size="36">I mean, I don't expect to
put on a pedal stool,</font>

124
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,600
<font size="36">but please, show a little respect!</font>

125
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,840
<font size="36">I'm sorry,
you don't expect to be put on a what?</font>

126
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
<font size="36">On a pedal stool.</font>

127
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,040
<font size="36">A pedal stool?</font>

128
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,320
<font size="36">What's a pedal stool?</font>

129
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,560
<font size="36">Oh, you know, you put women on it</font>

130
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,640
<font size="36">when you admire them,
you know, the phrase.</font>

131
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,680
<font size="36">Oh yeah, the famous phrase,
"to be put on a pedal stool".</font>

132
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,840
<font size="36">"Pedestal"!</font>

133
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,880
<font size="36">What?</font>

134
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,680
<font size="36">"Pedestal" is the word!</font>

135
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,880
<font size="36">What's a "pedal stool"?!</font>

136
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,400
<font size="36">Did you really think there was
such a thing as a pedal stool?</font>

137
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,200
<font size="36">Shut up, everyone has blind spots.</font>

138
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,160
<font size="36">Can you help me sort through
all this legal crap, please, Moss?</font>

139
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,920
<font size="36">I'd rather not. I've not had good
experiences with the legal system.</font>

140
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,800
<font size="36">How come?</font>

141
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,360
<font size="36">Well, when I was 11, I broke the
patio window, and my mother sued me.</font>

142
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,520
<font size="36">She sued you?</font>

143
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,080
<font size="36">Yeah, to teach me a lesson.</font>

144
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,720
<font size="36">She's always been a very
aggressive litigator.</font>

145
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,880
<font size="36">Can you even do that,

<font size="36">Well, if I didn't do it,
he wouldn't do it.</font>

<font size="36">I am, your Honour, but rest assured,</font>

237
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,400
<font size="36">it will be a normal examination.</font>

238
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,560

sounds like a paragon of virtue.</font>

281
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,720

And furthermore, I would like</font>

282

286
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,360

287
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,520
<font size="36">What?</font>

288
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,640
<font size="36">What did you say the case was?
May I have it read back please?</font>

<font size="36">"A damp squid?"</font>

291
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,080
<font size="36">What does that mean?</font>

292
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,720
<font size="36">Oh, Jen, it's an expression.</font>

293
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,280
<font size="36">It means that I believe</font>

294
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,480
<font size="36">that everything that's been said
in this case, everyone already knew.</font>

295
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,480
<font size="36">Mmmm, yes,
but did you say "damp squid"?</font>

296
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,960
<font size="36">That's right.</font>

297
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,640
<font size="36">Did you not mean, "damp squib"?</font>

298
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,880
<font size="36">No, it's "squid".</font>

299
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,520
<font size="36">What's a squib?</font>

300
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,320
<font size="36">It's not "squid".
Squids are already damp!</font>

301
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,000
<font size="36">Hence the phrase!</font>

302
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,280
<font size="36">Your Honour! Please!</font>

303
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,840
<font size="36">It is "squib".</font>

304
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,240
<font size="36">I must say, I find it extraordinary
that you, a man in your early 30s,</font>

305
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,160
<font size="36">could have reached this point
in your life without knowing
that it is "squib".</font>

306
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,880
<font size="36">I think it's "squid".</font>

307
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,440
<font size="36">I have no further questions.</font>

308
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,560
<font size="36">No, no, no, wait, wait, wait!</font>

309
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,280
<font size="36">That will be all.</font>

310
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,560
<font size="36">Everyone has a blind spot!</font>

311
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,560
<font size="36">I said that will be all!</font>

312
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,040
<font size="36">Your name is Maurice Moss,
is it not?</font>

313
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,600
<font size="36">Ehm...</font>

314
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,240
<font size="36">Your name is Maurice Moss,
is it not?</font>

315
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,880
<font size="36">Sorry, bit nervous... So... Yeah...</font>

316
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,480
<font size="36">Fizzy! It's very fizzy.</font>

317
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,360
<font size="36">It's fizzy. Gone fizzy.</font>

318
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:45,840
<font size="36">FZZZT!</font>

319
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,640
<font size="36">Ow, come on!</font>

320
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,200
<font size="36">That's electric.
That's electric in there.</font>

321
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,960
<font size="36">Just got a shock.</font>

322
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,640
<font size="36">Your name is Maurice Moss,
is it not?</font>

323
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,560
<font size="36">It is not.</font>

324
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,920
<font size="36">Sorry, yeah, sorry, sorry.</font>

325
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,920
<font size="36">My mother sued me.</font>

326
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,360
<font size="36">Relax. Take your time.</font>

327
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,440
<font size="36">Try to answer the questions
as clearly as you can.</font>

328
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,280
<font size="36">Thank you, my love.</font>

329
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,840
<font size="36">Your name is Maurice Moss,
is it not?</font>

330
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,800
<font size="36">Chair. It was the chair's fault.</font>

331
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,240
<font size="36">No further questions, my lud.</font>

332
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,240
<font size="36">Don't you have anything?</font>

333
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,720
<font size="36">She's going to take you
to the cleaners, Mr Reynholm.</font>

334
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,840
<font size="36">Yup, I suppose she will.</font>

335
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,680
<font size="36">What's that?</font>

336
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,320
<font size="36">Oh, God.</font>

337
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,840
<font size="36">I think I may have
found our miracle.</font>

338
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,320
<font size="36">Can you state your full name,
please?</font>

339
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,760
<font size="36">Richmond Felicity Avenal.</font>

340
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,840
<font size="36">And you worked at
Reynholm Industries for a time?</font>

341
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,320
<font size="36">I did, for over four years.</font>

342
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,600
<font size="36">And what did you do?</font>

343
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,520
<font size="36">I don't know.</font>

344
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,720
<font size="36">Why did you leave?</font>

345
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,080
<font size="36">Well, my life wasn't really going
anywhere. I was part of the whole</font>

346
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,800
<font size="36">goth/ death metal subculture
but it wasn't making me happy.</font>

347
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,080
<font size="36">It was all a bit gloomy.</font>

348
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:37,640
<font size="36">It was round about that point
that I developed scurvy.</font>

349
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,000
<font size="36">Now that sounds unpleasant.</font>

350
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,800
<font size="36">On the contrary.
Catching scurvy was the best thing
that ever happened to me.</font>

351
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,880
<font size="36">It made me take a long hard look
in the mirror.</font>

352
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,320
<font size="36">And I didn't like what I saw,
I can tell you that.</font>

353
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,120
<font size="36">Not just because my teeth
had fallen out.</font>

354
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,440
<font size="36">Which is why I founded
From Goth2Boss.</font>

355
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,600
<font size="36">Is it OK if I play a DVD?</font>

356
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,400
<font size="36">Does it have anything whatsoever
to do with this case?</font>

357
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,240
<font size="36">Not really, Your Honour.</font>

358
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,240
<font size="36">Then you may proceed.</font>

359
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,320
<font size="36">Where are you going?
Is it to the top?</font>

360
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,880
<font size="36">If not, why not?</font>

361
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,640
<font size="36">Go to the bloody top!
Is it because you're a goth?</font>

362
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,160
<font size="36">Did you know that goths have some of
the lowest life satisfaction levels</font>

363
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,120
<font size="36">of any subculture with the exception
of traffic wardens?</font>

364
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,240
<font size="36">That's why you don't see
any goth traffic wardens.</font>

365
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,120
<font size="36">That would be a deadly combination!</font>

366
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,120
<font size="36">We at Goth2Boss work with goths at
various locations around the UK</font>

367
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,160
<font size="36">to bring out
their hidden potential...</font>

368
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,080
<font size="36">by encouraging them to engage in
everyday, healthy pursuits</font>

369
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,720
<font size="36">such as sports.</font>

370
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,840
<font size="36">Mixing with other humans.</font>

371
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,400
<font size="36">Extended laughter sessions.</font>

372
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,200
<font size="36">Introducing colour to your wardrobe.</font>

373
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,440
<font size="36">Just look at these results.
This is Debbie. She used to</font>

374
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,160
<font size="36">hang around railway stations
with her hands in her sleeves.</font>

375
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,400
<font size="36">Now she's a lifeguard in Mumbai!</font>

376
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,640
<font size="36">From Goth2Boss, you know it makes
sense. Unless you're not a goth,</font>

377
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,600
<font size="36">in which case, from Goth2Boss.
Remember the name.</font>

378
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,480
<font size="36">But what does that have to do with</font>

379
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,800
<font size="36">my divorce proceedings,
m'kind fellow?</font>

380
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,240
<font size="36">Well, Mr Reynholm,
I'm here to tell you that that woman</font>

381
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,480
<font size="36">is not Victoria Reynholm!</font>

382
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,320
<font size="36">Her name is Melanie Crawford,</font>

383
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,560
<font size="36">a former From Goth2Boss pupil
of mine!</font>

384
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,720
<font size="36">Sing, you canary!</font>

385
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,920
<font size="36">Well, during our sessions,
she seemed more interested
in you than getting better.</font>

386
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,040
<font size="36">I don't think she ever
truly exorcised the goth within.</font>

387
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,120
<font size="36">Scratch away that fake tan</font>

388
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,160
<font size="36">and beneath you'll find
the purest white foundation!</font>

389
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,520
<font size="36">Yeah, that was more of a phrase
than anything.</font>

390
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,680
<font size="36">Oh, actually, um...
No sorry, that's not her!</font>

391
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,600
<font size="36">Oh, sorry about that. That's not her.</font>

392
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,960
<font size="36">Ladies and gentlemen of the jury.</font>

393
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:54,040
<font size="36">You've heard a few things over the
past few days, none of which cast me</font>

394
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,160
<font size="36">in a particularly favourable light.</font>

395
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,920
<font size="36">Stories of expensive sex tapes,
rumours of me killing my first wife.</font>

396
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,640
<font size="36">No. No-one's mentioned that.</font>

397
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:11,680
<font size="36">You know, there's one thing
I do want to say.</font>

398
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,240
<font size="36">Just one thing, that I...</font>

399
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,560
<font size="36">Mr Reynholm?</font>

400
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,840
<font size="36">Mr Reynholm, please.</font>

401
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:34,960
<font size="36">Mr Reynholm, this really is the most
pathetic display I have ever seen.</font>

402
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,800
<font size="36">May I say something, your Honour?</font>

403
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,840
<font size="36">Why not?</font>

404
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,600
<font size="36">Lying here,</font>

405
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:45,400
<font size="36">pretending to have a heart attack,
you see a desperate man.</font>

406
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,840
<font size="36">Not pretending.</font>

407
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,680
<font size="36">A man who has exhausted all of
his time, all of his resources,</font>

408
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:57,360
<font size="36">on an expensive trial
that has resulted in humiliation.</font>

409
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,880
<font size="36">But think not of him. Think of the
employees of Reynholm Industries.</font>

410
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,600
<font size="36">Think of the man
who was sued by his mother.</font>

411
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:11,000
<font size="36">The simpleton who thought the phrase
"damp squid" was correct.</font>

412
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:17,280
<font size="36">These are the people I want you to
consider when making your judgement.</font>

413
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,200
<font size="36">For Reynholm is not just
the name of this ridiculous man</font>

414
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,080
<font size="36">who keeps opening his eyes
whenever he thinks no-one's looking.</font>

415
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:31,800
<font size="36">Reynholm
is the name of the family his
employees have found in each other.</font>

416
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,680
<font size="36">We are all Reynholms.</font>

417
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,040
<font size="36">Hurt him, and you hurt...</font>

418
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,640
<font size="36">Oh, all right then,
we'll take 70 million.</font>

419
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,960
<font size="36">Hooray!</font>

420
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,880
<font size="36">I'm getting oak.</font>
