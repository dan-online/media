<font face="sans-serif" size="47">This programme contains adult humour.</font>

00:00:35,743 --> 00:00:39,383
<font face="sans-serif" size="47"># We don't need no education... #</font>

3
00:00:39,423 --> 00:00:43,023
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yes, you do.
You've just used a double negative.</font>

4
00:00:49,903 --> 00:00:51,263
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Notice anything?</font>

5
00:00:51,303 --> 00:00:53,303
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What? Guess.</font>

6
00:00:53,343 --> 00:00:55,383
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Something wrong with your eyes.</font>

7
00:00:55,423 --> 00:00:58,743
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">No, I have a new cup.
What's wrong with my eyes?</font>

8
00:00:58,783 --> 00:01:01,543
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It's not very distinctive. How's
anyone supposed to know it's yours?</font>

9
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:04,703
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">There's a picture of me on it.</font>

10
00:01:04,743 --> 00:01:06,143
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">No, there isn't!</font>

11
00:01:06,183 --> 00:01:07,383
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yes, there is.</font>

12
00:01:07,423 --> 00:01:08,103
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">No, there isn't, Moss.</font>

13
00:01:08,143 --> 00:01:12,063
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yes, there is. I am sick of
my things going walkabout.</font>

14
00:01:12,103 --> 00:01:15,423
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">With this picture, everyone knows
that a certain Mr Moss</font>

15
00:01:15,463 --> 00:01:17,543
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">might be looking for his cup...</font>

16
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:18,863
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">There is nothing on the cup!</font>

17
00:01:18,903 --> 00:01:22,103
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Wrangle with him and you'll
find your hand full, my friend.</font>

18
00:01:22,143 --> 00:01:24,543
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Wrangle with who?!
There's no-one there!</font>

19
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:25,143
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Morning.</font>

20
00:01:25,183 --> 00:01:26,703
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Morning.</font>

21
00:01:26,743 --> 00:01:28,663
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">D'you have a nice weekend?</font>

22
00:01:28,703 --> 00:01:29,863
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It was all right, thanks.</font>

23
00:01:29,903 --> 00:01:31,063
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Not you.</font>

24
00:01:31,103 --> 00:01:33,023
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I did too.</font>

25
00:01:33,063 --> 00:01:34,663
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">< Nice scarf.</font>

26
00:01:34,703 --> 00:01:35,543
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I'm not wearing a scarf.</font>

27
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:36,863
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Not you, Moss!</font>

28
00:01:38,303 --> 00:01:40,823
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Notice anything new about Moss?</font>

29
00:01:40,863 --> 00:01:42,103
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">His eyes?</font>

30
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,423
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What is wrong with my eyes?!</font>

31
00:01:44,463 --> 00:01:47,343
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">No, he has a new cup.
It's the talk of the office!</font>

32
00:01:47,383 --> 00:01:49,903
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yes, I think I read about it
in Heat.</font>

33
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,703
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Receptionist, third floor,
Gloria what's-her-name,</font>

34
00:01:52,743 --> 00:01:54,623
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">have you seen her baby?</font>

35
00:01:54,663 --> 00:01:56,863
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I didn't even know she was pregnant.</font>

36
00:01:56,903 --> 00:01:58,543
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">She was out to here.</font>

37
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:01,983
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yeah, I thought she was
stealing office equipment.</font>

38
00:02:02,023 --> 00:02:04,383
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">That's how I got that monitor home.</font>

39
00:02:11,863 --> 00:02:14,503
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Do you want to sit here?</font>

40
00:02:18,783 --> 00:02:19,623
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What?</font>

41
00:02:19,663 --> 00:02:21,143
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Ask me where it is.</font>

42
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:22,423
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Where was it?</font>

43
00:02:22,463 --> 00:02:23,823
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">The picture.</font>

44
00:02:25,863 --> 00:02:26,823
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Where's the picture, Moss?</font>

45
00:02:26,863 --> 00:02:28,423
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It's on the base, Roy.</font>

46
00:02:28,463 --> 00:02:29,983
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">OK, well, let's see it, then.</font>

47
00:02:30,023 --> 00:02:34,823
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Sure. I pour hot squash over myself
and we all have a good chuckle.</font>

48
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,823
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Everyone except muggins here.</font>

49
00:02:38,823 --> 00:02:41,063
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I'll show you in a minute.</font>

50
00:02:41,103 --> 00:02:42,463
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Can I ask you two a question?</font>

51
00:02:42,503 --> 00:02:44,543
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Please, Christ, yes.</font>

52
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:46,063
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Wait, one moment.</font>

53
00:02:48,943 --> 00:02:49,903
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">OK, go.</font>

54
00:02:49,943 --> 00:02:53,583
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">How can you two live like this?</font>

55
00:02:53,623 --> 00:02:55,063
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">How can you two...?</font>

56
00:02:55,103 --> 00:02:58,023
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Don't Google the question, Moss!</font>

57
00:02:58,343 --> 00:02:59,823
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What are you talking about?</font>

58
00:02:59,863 --> 00:03:01,743
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It's so disgusting in here.</font>

59
00:03:01,783 --> 00:03:06,063
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I know nobody comes down here,
but it doesn't mean
you have to live like animals.</font>

60
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:08,943
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You can clean that window
and you'd have a bit of light.</font>

61
00:03:08,983 --> 00:03:10,063
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What window?</font>

62
00:03:10,103 --> 00:03:11,343
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">That one up there.</font>

63
00:03:11,383 --> 00:03:12,943
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yeah, that's not a window.</font>

64
00:03:12,983 --> 00:03:16,943
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yes, it is. Get it clean,
you'll have some light in here.</font>

65
00:03:16,983 --> 00:03:18,863
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I think that we have plenty of light.</font>

66
00:03:23,343 --> 00:03:25,303
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I think that's fine!</font>

67
00:03:25,343 --> 00:03:26,863
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Look at that CD tray.</font>

68
00:03:26,903 --> 00:03:29,303
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Isn't that important?</font>

69
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:33,543
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Wouldn't you like to actually
put CDs in there at some point?</font>

70
00:03:33,583 --> 00:03:37,143
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yes, ideally, but
I haven't the heart to move them.</font>

71
00:03:40,423 --> 00:03:43,023
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">How did that even happen?</font>

72
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,543
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">OK, now I'm curious.</font>

73
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:48,823
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Give us a look at the picture, then.</font>

74
00:03:48,863 --> 00:03:50,543
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What picture?</font>

75
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,183
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">The picture on the cup!</font>

76
00:03:52,223 --> 00:03:54,223
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Right.</font>

77
00:03:56,823 --> 00:03:58,463
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Behold!</font>

78
00:04:00,503 --> 00:04:02,183
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">There's nothing there!</font>

79
00:04:02,223 --> 00:04:03,983
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What?!</font>

80
00:04:04,023 --> 00:04:06,103
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">This isn't my cup!</font>

81
00:04:14,423 --> 00:04:15,903
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What is that?</font>

82
00:04:15,943 --> 00:04:17,863
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Goat's cheese salad.</font>

83
00:04:17,903 --> 00:04:19,503
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Ugh!</font>

84
00:04:19,543 --> 00:04:20,783
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You don't like goat's cheese?</font>

85
00:04:20,823 --> 00:04:23,343
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I don't like goat's anything!</font>

86
00:04:23,383 --> 00:04:26,103
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I don't like goats
being involved in</font>

87
00:04:26,143 --> 00:04:29,063
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">any stage of
the food-production process.</font>

88
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:32,863
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Would I blow everyone's mind
if I ate dessert first?</font>

89
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:37,503
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What are you eating, anyway?</font>

90
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:40,543
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It's a bucket of fried chicken.</font>

91
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:42,823
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It comes in a real bucket now.</font>

92
00:04:42,863 --> 00:04:46,783
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Tell me,
what's behind that red door?</font>

93
00:04:46,823 --> 00:04:48,663
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">CRASH</font>

94
00:04:51,823 --> 00:04:52,783
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">BOTH: Nothing.</font>

95
00:04:52,823 --> 00:04:54,623
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">There must be something behind it.</font>

96
00:04:54,663 --> 00:04:56,343
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">There's nothing behind
the red door, Jen.</font>

97
00:04:56,383 --> 00:04:57,903
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Well then, I can just...</font>

98
00:04:57,943 --> 00:05:00,583
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">No, Jen, it's just a boring
old store room, that's all!</font>

99
00:05:00,623 --> 00:05:03,703
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It's just a store room
where we keep the snibbits.</font>

100
00:05:03,743 --> 00:05:05,823
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What's a snibbit?</font>

101
00:05:05,863 --> 00:05:07,503
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It's a kind of plange.</font>

102
00:05:07,543 --> 00:05:09,823
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Oh, a plange for the computers?</font>

103
00:05:09,863 --> 00:05:11,463
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yes, computer plange!</font>

104
00:05:11,503 --> 00:05:15,143
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">If it's a store room, we can store
some of this stuff in...</font>

105
00:05:15,183 --> 00:05:18,223
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">No, Jen! Look, I know that
you want to make your mark down here,</font>

106
00:05:18,263 --> 00:05:21,583
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">and that's really sweet,
but you can't</font>

107
00:05:21,623 --> 00:05:26,503
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">just go messing around with
the snibbit store room willy-nilly!</font>

108
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:30,863
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You can't upset the whole
harmony of the place!</font>

109
00:05:30,903 --> 00:05:32,823
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Harmony?! What harmony?!</font>

110
00:05:32,863 --> 00:05:35,823
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I know that the place looks like
a bit of a mess,</font>

111
00:05:35,863 --> 00:05:39,103
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">but it's actually
a very delicate ecosystem.</font>

112
00:05:41,823 --> 00:05:43,503
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Everything is connected.</font>

113
00:05:46,863 --> 00:05:49,143
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It's like the rainforest.</font>

114
00:05:50,703 --> 00:05:54,743
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You change one thing,
even the tiniest bit</font>

115
00:05:54,783 --> 00:05:57,783
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">and the whole rainforest dies!</font>

116
00:06:00,463 --> 00:06:03,183
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">You don't want
the rainforest to die, do you?!</font>

117
00:06:03,223 --> 00:06:05,743
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">No, I really don't want
the rainforest to die.</font>

118
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:08,783
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">That's what will happen
if you open the red door.</font>

119
00:06:08,823 --> 00:06:10,223
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">PHONE</font>

120
00:06:11,303 --> 00:06:14,983
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Hello, IT. Have you tried
turning it off and on again?</font>

121
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,743
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">OK, are you sure
that it's plugged in?!</font>

122
00:06:20,303 --> 00:06:22,583
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">OK, I'll be up in a minute.</font>

123
00:06:23,823 --> 00:06:25,103
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">What was that about?</font>

124
00:06:25,143 --> 00:06:26,143
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Girl on fourth.</font>

125
00:06:26,183 --> 00:06:28,143
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Ooh, job. You gonna go?</font>

126
00:06:28,183 --> 00:06:31,303
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Yeah, in a while. It can wait.</font>

127
00:06:31,343 --> 00:06:34,543
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Why can it wait? She probably needs
to get on, she needs a computer.</font>

128
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:37,543
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I am reading a comic.</font>

129
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:40,463
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">I knew it. Every time
I used to phone IT in my last job,</font>

130
00:06:40,503 --> 00:06:43,663
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">it'd take a good couple
of hours before someone got to me.</font>

131
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:46,783
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">That is how we do it.
You can't go off straightaway</font>

132
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,983
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">or they'll all expect it.
You're killing the rainforest!</font>

133
00:06:49,023 --> 00:06:50,583
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">Stop saying that!</font>

134
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:53,623
<font face="sans-serif" size="47">It's more than that. Me and this
