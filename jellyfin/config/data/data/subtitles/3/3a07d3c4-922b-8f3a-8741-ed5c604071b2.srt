36

Retreat you must.

00:02:14,797 --> 00:02:16,880
On the moon below is my mission.

00:02:17,296 --> 00:02:19,088
There I must go.

39
00:02:22,963 --> 00:02:26,254

can do better?

<i>Our droid armies outnumber</i>
<i>the Republic clones a hundred to one.</i>

43
00:02:37,296 --> 00:02:41,672
Perhaps, but I have heard
that a single Jedi

45
00:02:44,505 --> 00:02:45,338
Quickly now.

48
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:52,046
The enemy will fire at anything we launch.

49
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:54,672
Then launch all of them you will, hmm?

50
00:03:01,797 --> 00:03:05,713
<i>Master Yoda's powers</i>

00:03:08,546 --> 00:03:12,588
<i>Indeed. But when you decide to join us,</i>

00:03:12,672 --> 00:03:15,588
<i>my apprentice will contact me.</i>

54
00:03:28,755 --> 00:03:31,046
Hang on. Almost.

55
00:03:34,755 --> 00:03:36,463
What a terrible shot.

56
00:03:36,546 --> 00:03:39,755
Oh, well, it's my programming.

57
00:03:42,338 --> 00:03:44,380
That was a close one!

58
00:03:44,463 --> 00:03:46,254
General, I think we're out of range.

59
00:03:46,338 --> 00:03:47,505
I agree.

60
00:03:47,588 --> 00:03:49,922

00:03:52,713 --> 00:03:55,004

has fled the system.

00:04:29,088 --> 00:04:31,046
had frightened you off.

72
00:04:31,129 --> 00:04:32,380
<i>Delayed have I been.</i>

73
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,838
<i>But not too far away am I now.</i>

74
00:04:35,213 --> 00:04:39,338
<i>Unaware I was</i>
<i>Count Dooku was invited to our meeting.</i>

75
00:04:39,421 --> 00:04:41,546
The count invited himself.

76
00:04:41,838 --> 00:04:44,171
He assures me that, in this time of war,

77
00:04:44,254 --> 00:04:47,922
his droids can offer my world
greater security than your Jedi.

78
00:04:48,004 --> 00:04:50,755
<i>Hmm. A matter of debate that is.</i>

79
00:04:51,088 --> 00:04:54,713
Your Majesty might prefer more than words.

80
00:04:54,797 --> 00:04:56,380
What do you have in mind?

81
00:04:56,463 --> 00:05:00,588
If Yoda is indeed the Jedi warrior
you believe he is,

82
00:05:00,672 --> 00:05:02,630
let him prove it.

83
00:05:02,713 --> 00:05:05,672
Allow me to send my best troops
to capture him.

84
00:05:05,922 --> 00:05:09,088
If he escapes, join the Republic.

85
00:05:09,421 --> 00:05:11,963
But should my droids defeat Yoda,

86
00:05:12,213 --> 00:05:15,213
consider an alliance with the Separatists.

87
00:05:15,296 --> 00:05:19,004
I did not request Yoda's presence here
to test him in battle.

88
00:05:19,088 --> 00:05:21,546
<i>Accept the challenge I do, Your Highness.</i>

89

<i>Arrive by nightfall I will.</i>

90
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:29,004
Master Yoda must be given a fair fight.

91
00:05:29,088 --> 00:05:31,171
My dear King Katuunko,

92
00:05:31,254 --> 00:05:33,213

We'll have something for 'em.

99
00:06:06,838 --> 00:06:09,213

102
00:06:14,797 --> 00:06:19,088
I will see the Jedi gets his "fair fight."

103
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,004
Carry only what you need.

104
00:06:21,088 --> 00:06:23,046
Too much weight, slow you down it will.

105

106
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:29,672
Come, come, lieutenant. Hurry we must.

107
00:06:30,546 --> 00:06:33,380
Sir, the rendezvous point is that way.

108
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,546
As is our enemy.

109
00:06:36,088 --> 00:06:38,880
To reach our goal,
a straight path we will not follow.

110

Let's move it, boys.

111
00:06:43,713 --> 00:06:45,588
Find Master Yoda.

112
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:48,380
Uh, what does he look like?

113
00:06:48,463 --> 00:06:51,630
He'll be the small, shriveled green one

114
00:06:51,713 --> 00:06:53,380
with the lightsaber!

115
00:06:53,838 --> 00:06:55,004
Small, huh?

116
00:06:55,088 --> 00:06:58,296
Don't worry, Supreme Leader,
we'll take care of him.

117
00:07:13,588 --> 00:07:15,088
I think I see them.

118
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:17,046
They're hiding deep in the trees!

119
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,713
Fire on Sector 11.

120
00:07:28,004 --> 00:07:31,838
At ease be, my friends.
Within range we are not.

121

Uh, hold it. Hold it.

122

I said hold it! Wait!

123
00:07:42,338 --> 00:07:44,088
That's far enough!

124
00:07:44,171 --> 00:07:48,046
I mean it! Stop! I said stop!

125
00:07:49,546 --> 00:07:51,296
We're too big to fit in there.

126
00:07:51,546 --> 00:07:53,922
No, we're not. Watch this.

127
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,296
You were right.

128
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,421
Next time, listen to orders!

129
00:08:03,213 --> 00:08:05,338
Those tanks are too big to follow.

130
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:09,129
See, see? Size is not everything, hmm?

131
00:08:09,838 --> 00:08:14,046
Smaller in number are we,
but larger in mind. [giggles]

132

How should I know?

134
00:08:19,088 --> 00:08:21,296
There's no figuring a Jedi Master.

135
00:08:21,922 --> 00:08:23,797
Infantry, advance.

136
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,713
Go get 'em, boys.

137
00:08:32,254 --> 00:08:34,755
Sir, there are two patrols
coming in on foot.

138
00:08:34,838 --> 00:08:37,338
Now is the time
to face the enemy, lieutenant.

139
00:08:37,421 --> 00:08:38,880
Ambush them we will!

140
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:43,296
We'll flank them from the south.

141
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,546

You bucket head! That's the Jedi!

146
00:09:09,672 --> 00:09:12,755
He is a little one. Blast him!

147
00:09:16,338 --> 00:09:18,880
Split up by squad and spread out.

148

Okay, clankers, suck laser!

150
00:09:39,463 --> 00:09:40,546
Where's the general?

151
00:09:40,838 --> 00:09:42,505
I don't know. We got separated.

-[blasters firing]
-Clankers!

153
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,922
Fall back. There are too many of them.

155
00:09:59,505 --> 00:10:01,546
He's around here somewhere.

Hey, get off of me!

157
00:10:06,004 --> 00:10:07,296
Don't move.

Ha! Master Yoda is living up
to my expectations.

160
00:10:25,213 --> 00:10:29,213
Commander, have you pinpointed
the Jedi's location?

161
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:30,380
<i>Affirmative.</i>

162
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,171
<i>The clones gave away their position.</i>

Get out of the way! All of you.

Ha! You found us just in time, sir.

180
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,630
Left behind no one will be.

181
00:12:01,713 --> 00:12:03,129
[metallic clanking]

182
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,546
Rollies, inbound!

183
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,046
Retreat! Cover you I will!

184
00:12:24,004 --> 00:12:25,672
<i>Republic troops are injured.</i>

185
00:12:25,755 --> 00:12:28,546
<i>The Jedi is in full retreat,</i>
<i>Supreme Leader.</i>

186
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,213
Good. Pursue them without delay.

187
00:12:32,088 --> 00:12:35,004
The contest is not over yet.

188
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,630
Master Yoda,

189
00:12:37,713 --> 00:12:40,588
I hear you're having trouble
with the droid army.

190
00:12:40,672 --> 00:12:43,296
<i>Trouble? I know nothing of this trouble.</i>

191
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,129
<i>Look forward to our meeting soon I do.</i>

192
00:12:47,797 --> 00:12:51,129
The Jedi won't elude me for long.

193
00:13:01,338 --> 00:13:03,296
Are you sure we should go
in there, general?

194
00:13:03,797 --> 00:13:04,922
There's no way out.

195
00:13:05,004 --> 00:13:07,672
Now rest we must.

196
00:13:32,213 --> 00:13:33,630
We're low on ammo, sir.

197
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,588
Only two grenades
and one rocket for the launcher.

198
00:13:37,672 --> 00:13:39,630
Against a battalion? [scoffs]

199
00:13:39,713 --> 00:13:41,213
Forget it. We've lost.

200
00:13:41,296 --> 00:13:43,880
So certain of defeat are you, hmm?

201
00:13:43,963 --> 00:13:45,463
[whooshing]

202
00:13:47,088 --> 00:13:49,380
With respect, general,
maybe you should go on.

203
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,963
Let us slow 'em down.

204
00:13:53,088 --> 00:13:55,880
All around us
is that which we need to prevail.

205
00:13:55,963 --> 00:13:57,296
Yes. Hmm.

206
00:14:00,838 --> 00:14:04,171
Come, sit. Your helmets, remove them.

207
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,963
Your faces I wish to see.

208
00:14:08,505 --> 00:14:10,505
There's not much to look at here, sir.

209
00:14:10,588 --> 00:14:12,463
We all share the same face.

210
00:14:12,546 --> 00:14:14,254
Deceive you, eyes can.

211
00:14:14,546 --> 00:14:18,088
In the Force,
very different each one of you are.

212
00:14:19,338 --> 00:14:22,338
Rys, always focused on the enemy are you.

213
00:14:23,922 --> 00:14:26,254
For inspiration, look to yourself

214
00:14:26,588 --> 00:14:27,797
and those beside you.

215
00:14:30,338 --> 00:14:33,088
Jek. Concerned about weapons you are.

216
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,755
Weapons do not win battles.

217
00:14:36,046 --> 00:14:38,171
Your mind, powerful it is.

218
00:14:38,254 --> 00:14:41,672
Hmm. Outthink the droids you can.

219
00:14:43,296 --> 00:14:45,963
Thire, rush not into fights.

220
00:14:46,046 --> 00:14:47,463
Long is the war.

221
00:14:47,797 --> 00:14:50,880
Only by surviving it will you prevail.

222
00:14:51,505 --> 00:14:52,713
Yes. Hmm.

223
00:14:54,755 --> 00:14:56,630
Clones you may be.

224
00:14:57,171 --> 00:15:00,004
But the Force resides in all life-forms.

225
00:15:00,296 --> 00:15:03,338
Use it you can to quiet your mind.

226
00:15:03,588 --> 00:15:07,046
[low rumbling]

227
00:15:14,254 --> 00:15:15,296
Tanks.

228
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,838
Is that the best they can throw at us?

229
00:15:16,922 --> 00:15:20,004
Yeah, but I've only got one shot left.

230
00:15:20,088 --> 00:15:22,088
-Greet them, I will.
-General,

231
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,505
you don't plan to take
that whole column by yourself?

232
00:15:26,254 --> 00:15:29,880
[giggles] Have you three I do!
Outnumbered are they.

233
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:34,213
Know the time to help me you will.

234
00:15:35,546 --> 00:15:37,713
[grunting]

235
00:15:48,004 --> 00:15:49,213
It's the Jedi!

236
00:15:49,296 --> 00:15:50,713
Block his escape!

237
00:15:51,296 --> 00:15:53,254
Prepare to fire!

238
00:15:54,046 --> 00:15:56,254
[machinery whirring]

239
00:15:58,505 --> 00:16:01,254
<i>Supreme Leader, we've found the Jedi.</i>

240
00:16:01,338 --> 00:16:03,421
Excellent. Where is he?

241
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:06,338
<i>He's just sitting here</i>
<i>in front of our tanks.</i>

242
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,296
Shoot him! Shoot him now!

243
00:16:09,296 --> 00:16:12,296
Quickly! Ready, aim, fire!

244
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,463
Fire!

245
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,755
[lightsaber whooshes]

246
00:16:23,338 --> 00:16:25,004
He's gone under the tank.

249
00:16:32,797 --> 00:16:34,088
Oh, no!

250
00:16:34,463 --> 00:16:37,588
Run for it!

251
00:16:38,963 --> 00:16:43,046
But I just got promoted!

252
00:16:47,505 --> 00:16:49,588
Doesn't look like
the general needs help to me.

253
00:16:56,338 --> 00:16:57,380
[electronic beeping]

254
00:16:57,463 --> 00:16:59,213
We've got him in our sights!

255
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,797
[droid screaming]

256
00:17:10,713 --> 00:17:14,672
[chuckles] That's a lot of smoke
for a surrender.

257
00:17:16,213 --> 00:17:17,296
Report.

258
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,254
What's going on over there?

259
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:20,880
224, come in!

260
00:17:22,004 --> 00:17:24,171
Where is 224?

261
00:17:24,254 --> 00:17:25,755
<i>Destroyed, Supreme Leader.</i>

262

[screams]

264
00:17:30,004 --> 00:17:33,963
I think perhaps all those stories
about the Jedi are true.

265
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:38,380
The fight isn't over yet, Majesty.

266

The general's cutting 'em up.

-[laughter]
-We've got trouble.

270
00:17:54,129 --> 00:17:56,004
The clankers sent reinforcements.

271
00:17:57,963 --> 00:18:00,880
The general's too busy with that tank.
He won't see 'em coming.

272
00:18:00,963 --> 00:18:03,713
I think I know how to deal with them.

-Yeah! Great shot, sir!
-Yeah.

00:18:31,088 --> 00:18:33,088
That's giving it to the clankers.

Hmm.

Learned something today,
have you, lieutenant, hmm?

281
00:18:44,338 --> 00:18:47,004
I think we all did, general.

[grunts]

283
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,004
Come. Behind schedule are we.

284
00:18:53,505 --> 00:18:55,004
Not polite to be late.

285
00:19:04,421 --> 00:19:06,380
You were right, Count Dooku.

286
00:19:06,463 --> 00:19:10,338
One Jedi is not worth
a hundred battle droids,

287
00:19:10,421 --> 00:19:12,421
more like a thousand.

288
00:19:12,922 --> 00:19:16,004
I'm sorry,
but I will be joining the Republic.

<i>I promise you won't regret it.</i>

291
00:19:21,838 --> 00:19:25,296
Your agent also promised me
Yoda would get a fair fight.

292
00:19:25,505 --> 00:19:28,380
I will not deal with those
who break their words.

293
00:19:29,213 --> 00:19:32,213
<i>So be it. Perhaps our negotiations</i>

294
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,963
<i>will be more fruitful with your successor.</i>

I am very pleased to meet you at last.

300
00:20:00,338 --> 00:20:03,505
Share the feeling I do, King Katuunko.

Failed you Ventress has, count.

303

I don't fear you, Jedi.

304
00:20:12,797 --> 00:20:15,588
Strong you are
with the dark side, young one,

305
00:20:15,838 --> 00:20:17,046
but not that strong.

306
00:20:20,588 --> 00:20:23,004
Still much to learn you have.

307
00:20:25,963 --> 00:20:27,838
Surrender you should.

314
00:21:02,004 --> 00:21:05,713
Perhaps now, begin negotiations we can.

315
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:08,463
That is not necessary, my friend.

316
00:21:08,755 --> 00:21:10,296
