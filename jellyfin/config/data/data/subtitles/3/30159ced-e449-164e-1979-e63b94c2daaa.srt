<font size="36">This programme contains adult humour</font>

2
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,720
<font size="36">Hope this doesn't embarrass you, Jen,
but I find the best thing to do</font>

3
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,080
<font size="36">with a new employee is to size them
up with a long, hard stare.</font>

4
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,200
<font size="36">So! So.</font>

5
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,480
<font size="36">First day? Yes.</font>

6
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,840
<font size="36">Scary. Yes.</font>

7
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,920
<font size="36">Don't be scared.</font>

8
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,720
<font size="36">Well, I'm not really scared.
You should be.</font>

9
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,960
<font size="36">Well, I am a little bit scared.
Well, don't be.</font>

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,800
<font size="36">Make up your mind.</font>

11
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,760
<font size="36">So here you are.</font>

12
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,280
<font size="36">Yes, really looking forward to
getting to grips with the...</font>

13
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,600
<font size="36">I'm going to put you in IT,</font>

14
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,280
<font size="36">because you said on your CV you have
a lot of experience with computers.</font>

15
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,120
<font size="36">I did say that on my CV, yes.</font>

16
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:41,240
<font size="36">I have a lot of experience of the
whole computer thing, you know,</font>

17
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,600
<font size="36">e-mails, sending e-mails, receiving
e-mails and deleting e-mails.</font>

18
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,560
<font size="36">Um, I could go on.</font>

19
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,120
<font size="36">Do.</font>

20
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,600
<font size="36">The web.</font>

21
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,400
<font size="36">Using mouse. Mouses, using mice.</font>

22
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,400
<font size="36">Um, clicking, double clicking,</font>

23
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,080
<font size="36">the computer screen, of course.</font>

24
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,120
<font size="36">The keyboard, the bit that
goes on the floor down there.</font>

25
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,080
<font size="36">The hard drive?
Correct.</font>

26
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,200
<font size="36">Aha, well, you certainly seem to
know your stuff. That's settled.</font>

27
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,320
<font size="36">Got a good feeling about you, Jen,
and they need a new manager.</font>

28
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,760
<font size="36">Oh, fantastic. So the people I'll
be working with, what are they like?</font>

29
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,160
<font size="36">Standard nerds.</font>

30
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,080
<font size="36">PHONE RINGS</font>

31
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,800
<font size="36">RINGING CONTINUES</font>

32
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,920
<font size="36">RINGING CONTINUES</font>

33
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,320
<font size="36">Hello, IT.</font>

34
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,560
<font size="36">Have you tried
turning it off and on again?</font>

35
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,560
<font size="36">OK, well, the button on
the side, is it glowing?</font>

36
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,200
<font size="36">Yeah, you need to turn it on.</font>

37
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,480
<font size="36">The button turns it on.</font>

38
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,480
<font size="36">Yeah, yeah. You do know how
a button works, don't you?</font>

39
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,920
<font size="36">No, not on clothes.</font>

40
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,080
<font size="36">Hello, IT.</font>

41
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,360
<font size="36">Yeah-huh.</font>

42
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,480
<font size="36">Have you tried forcing
an unexpected reboot?</font>

43
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,600
<font size="36">No, no, there you go. No, there
you go, I just heard it come on.</font>

44
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,280
<font size="36">No, no, that's the music
you hear when it comes on.</font>

45
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,280
<font size="36">No, that's the music you hear when...
I'm sorry, are you from the past?</font>

46
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,960
<font size="36">See, the driver hooks the function
by patching the system call table,</font>

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,960
<font size="36">so it's not safe to unload it unless
another thread's about</font>

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,600
<font size="36">to jump in there and do its stuff</font>

49
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,680
<font size="36">and you don't want to end up
in the middle of invalid memory.</font>

50
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,840
<font size="36">Hello?</font>

51
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,720
<font size="36">Oh, really? Really, well, why don't
you come down here and make me, then!</font>

52
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,840
<font size="36">Huh? What, you think I'm afraid
of you? I'm not afraid of you,</font>

53
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,200
<font size="36">you can come down here any time
and I'll be waiting for you.</font>

54
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,600
<font size="36">That told her.</font>

55
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,560
<font size="36">Oh, God, it's about time you
got back. It's been all go.</font>

56
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,680
<font size="36">You had a job?</font>

57
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,840
<font size="36">Girl on fifth.</font>

58
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,560
<font size="36">Did you and her hit it off?</font>

59
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,440
<font size="36">Define "hit it off"?</font>

60
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,080
<font size="36">Did she continue talking to you
once you'd fixed her computer?</font>

61
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,400
<font size="36">No.</font>

62
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,960
<font size="36">And while I was working on it,
she rested a cup on my back.</font>

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,040
<font size="36">No?</font>

64
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,800
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

65
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,000
<font size="36">Unbelievable.</font>

66
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,160
<font size="36">Yeah, they've no
respect for us up there.</font>

67
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,560
<font size="36">No respect whatsoever.
We're all just drudgeons to them.</font>

68
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,480
<font size="36">Yes, if there were
such a thing as a drudgeon,</font>

69
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,800
<font size="36">that is what we'd be to them.</font>

70
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,560
<font size="36">It's like they're pally wally
when there's a problem</font>

71
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,280
<font size="36">with their printer but once it's
fixed...</font>

72
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,800
<font size="36">They toss us away
like yesterday's jam.</font>

73
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,200
<font size="36">Yes. Yesterday's jam.
That is what we are to them.</font>

74
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,120
<font size="36">TELEPHONE RINGS</font>

75
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,000
<font size="36">You know, actually that
doesn't really work as a thing.</font>

76
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,160
<font size="36">Because jam lasts for ages.</font>

77
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,120
<font size="36">Hello, IT.</font>

78
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,760
<font size="36">Have you tried turning
it off and on again?</font>

79
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,720
<font size="36">Unisex toilets.
You have unisex toilets.</font>

80
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,800
<font size="36">Like Ally McBeal.</font>

81
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,560
<font size="36">That's the sort of
place this is, Jen.</font>

82
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,160
<font size="36">A lot of sexy people not doing
much work and having affairs.</font>

83
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,120
<font size="36">Wow. Oh, my God, look at that view.</font>

84
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,640
<font size="36">I feel like I'm on top of the world.</font>

85
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,680
<font size="36">Well, Jen, this is where I leave you.</font>

86
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,160
<font size="36">'Floor 34.'</font>

87
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,800
<font size="36">Very exciting.</font>

88
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,680
<font size="36">OK, where am I going?</font>

89
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,120
<font size="36">All the way down to the basement.</font>

90
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,880
<font size="36">Good luck.</font>

91
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,200
<font size="36">'Get out of the lift.
Get out of the lift.</font>

92
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,800
<font size="36">'Get out of the lift.</font>

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,800
<font size="36">Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</font>

101
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,320
<font size="36">Oh, God. OK.</font>

102
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,280
<font size="36">Hello?</font>

103
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,400
<font size="36">Hello?</font>

104
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,840
<font size="36">Yes, I believe it was
Tolstoy who said...</font>

105
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,440
<font size="36">Oh, it seems we have a visitor.</font>

106
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,560
<font size="36">I'm sorry, myself and Maurice
were just engaged</font>

107
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,640
<font size="36">in quite a serious discussion about
books and such.</font>

108
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,240
<font size="36">We didn't hear you come in.</font>

109
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,000
<font size="36">Wait a second, you said it
was Tolstoy who said what?</font>

110
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,960
<font size="36">Oh, never mind that now, Maurice.</font>

111
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,760
<font size="36">When have you read Tolstoy?</font>

112
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,400
<font size="36">Shut up, Maurice.</font>

113
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,240
<font size="36">Why are you speaking in
that weird voice? When did...?</font>

114
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,520
<font size="36">I don't remember this conversation
at all.</font>

115
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,280
<font size="36">(LAUGHS)</font>

116
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,520
<font size="36">Don't let me disturb
you, I just wanted to...</font>

117
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,960
<font size="36">Oh, don't be silly...</font>

118
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,880
<font size="36">Many people come down here to visit.</font>

119
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,720
<font size="36">What are you talking about?</font>

120
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,760
<font size="36">Who comes down? What people?</font>

121
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,320
<font size="36">Why are you giving me the
secret signal to shut up?</font>

122
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,760
<font size="36">So what can we do you for?</font>

123
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,040
<font size="36">I'm the new head of this department.</font>

124
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,800
<font size="36">Is this my office?</font>

125
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,840
<font size="36">Why?
What did she...</font>

126
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,840
<font size="36">Did she just say what...?
I am the head of this department!</font>

127
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,080
<font size="36">I thought I was.</font>

128
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,720
<font size="36">Well, it's one of us, certainly
not her. I'm going to sort this out.</font>

129
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,040
<font size="36">Roy, you've got a head wound there.
Head wound!</font>

130
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,320
<font size="36">I don't want to be rude or anything</font>

131
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,880
<font size="36">but I wasn't informed of any
changes to this department.</font>

132
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,040
<font size="36">Oh, did they not tell you about me?</font>

133
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,920
<font size="36">No
and we are perfectly fine down here,</font>

134
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,760
<font size="36">thank you very much, we're more than
capable of taking care of ourselves.</font>

135
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,960
<font size="36">Sure, sure.
You know you're covered in blood.</font>

136
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,600
<font size="36">Moss.</font>

<font size="36">Amazon thingy.</font>

138
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,320
<font size="36">Oh, wicked. I know what this is,
it's the new Harry Potter.</font>

139
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,360
<font size="36">I got the
child edition and the adult edition</font>

140
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,360
<font size="36">just to check that there are
no differences in the text.</font>

141
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,080
<font size="36">Sorry, but I'm not going to be
able to deal with that woman!</font>

142
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,560
<font size="36">Is nobody else gonna get the
phone? I'll get it.</font>

143
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,560
<font size="36">No, that is not a phone.
I'm going to have a little lie down.</font>

144
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,400
<font size="36">KNOCKING</font>

145
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,800

00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,440
<font size="36">Yeah, Denholm, yeah, yeah.</font>

147
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,120
<font size="36">No, no, no, no, no.</font>

148
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,320
<font size="36">No, they've been fine so far.</font>

149
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,280
<font size="36">Yeah,
I think we're going to get on great.</font>

150
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,800
<font size="36">Yeah, I know.
All right then, no, you take care.</font>

151
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,440
<font size="36">All right, yeah, I will, yeah.</font>

152
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,640
<font size="36">OK, OK, take care, take care.</font>

153
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,760
<font size="36">OK, bye! Bye!</font>

154
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:20,280
<font size="36">So, hello. What can I do you -
what can I do for you?</font>

155
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,360
<font size="36">Hello. I was just wondering, do you
want me to connect up your phone?</font>

156
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,560
<font size="36">No, no, no, no, no, no,
it's working.</font>

157
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,040
<font size="36">Um,
I was just talking to Denholm there.</font>

158
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,800
<font size="36">But how?</font>

159
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,200
<font size="36">Would you mind, would you mind
closing the door for me?</font>

160
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,200
<font size="36">Oh, yeah, sure.</font>

161
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,200
<font size="36">Yeah, from the other side.</font>

162
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,280
<font size="36">Of course.</font>

163
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,200
<font size="36">Like this?</font>

164
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,440
<font size="36">That's it.</font>

165
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,240
<font size="36">With me on the...</font>

166
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,280
<font size="36">Thanks.</font>

167
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,360
<font size="36">Oh.</font>

168
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,520
<font size="36">Are you all right?</font>

169
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,520
<font size="36">Oh, yes, Moss, I'm fine.</font>

170
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,800
<font size="36">The nurse said I didn't do
myself any serious damage.</font>

171
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,200
<font size="36">I'm standing over here.</font>

172
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,840
<font size="36">I know, I know, I'm joking. I'm fine.
What are we going to do about her?</font>

173
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,480
<font size="36">Well, I just went in and she was
having a pretend conversation.</font>

174
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,880
<font size="36">Really?</font>

175
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,520
<font size="36">Yes, she's a little bit
weird to say the least.</font>

176
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,840
<font size="36">What's that?</font>

177
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,920
<font size="36">Oh, just water. Sometimes I get a
hot ear and this helps cool it down.</font>

178
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,520
<font size="36">She's quite the oddball.</font>

179
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,120
<font size="36">Did you notice how she didn't
even get excited</font>

180
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,960
<font size="36">when she saw this original ZX81?</font>

181
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,120
<font size="36">Yeah, that was weird.</font>

182
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,040
<font size="36">It's almost as if she doesn't
know anything about computers.</font>

183
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,080
<font size="36">What?
CRASHING</font>

184
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,400
<font size="36">What are you doing?</font>

185
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,080
<font size="36">Oh, don't worry, that's why
I always make two cups of tea.</font>

186
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,720
<font size="36">Anyway, what were we talking about?</font>

187
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,640
<font size="36">Oh, her not knowing
anything about computers.</font>

188
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,000
<font size="36">What?
CRASHING</font>

189
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,640
<font size="36">< We definitely want to
get rid of her.</font>

190
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,760
<font size="36">< Agreed, yeah.</font>

191
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,040
<font size="36">OK, so here's the plan.</font>

192
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,240
<font size="36">A plan. Let me put on my
slightly larger glasses.</font>

193
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,720
<font size="36">OK, hit me.</font>

194
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,760
<font size="36">OK we go in.</font>

195
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,320
<font size="36">When?</font>

196
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,880
<font size="36">You know, like in a minute.</font>

197
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,600
<font size="36">Will that be enough time for
me to get to know the plan?</font>

198
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,200
<font size="36">Yeah you know what, I shouldn't
have used the word "plan".</font>

199
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,040
<font size="36">I've gotten you over-excited.</font>

200
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,080
<font size="36">Would "scheme" be a better word?</font>

201
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,360
<font size="36">Although that's just as exciting,
I might even need these.</font>

202
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,040
<font size="36">All I was going to
say was, um, we go in,</font>

203
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,280
<font size="36">I make up a load of bollocks
about computers</font>

204
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,880
<font size="36">and we'll see
if she picks up on it.</font>

205
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,280
<font size="36">Yes, I can see why you didn't
want to use the word "plan".</font>

206
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,240
<font size="36">Let me do the talking.</font>

207
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,360
<font size="36">All right.</font>

208
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,800
<font size="36">Ooh, Moss, Moss.
OK, we need to get this right, yeah?</font>

209
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,880
<font size="36">We need to stay calm.</font>

210
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,600
<font size="36">We do not want to
go in there half cocked.</font>

211
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,720
<font size="36">OK...</font>

212
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,760
<font size="36">Hang on, guys. ></font>

213
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,840
<font size="36">How can I help?</font>

214
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,960
<font size="36">Well, we were just wondering,
now that you're the "boss".</font>

215
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,040
<font size="36">Would you like us to
access the data supplier</font>

216
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,520
<font size="36">and connect you to the matrix?</font>

217
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,920
<font size="36">You just made all that up.</font>

218
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,440
<font size="36">You don't know anything
about computers, admit it!</font>

219
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,480
<font size="36">Will you stop
trying to undermine me!</font>

220
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,360
<font size="36">Now get in there and do some
work to do with computers.</font>

221
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,920
<font size="36">I'll be in there in a
minute to check up on you.</font>

222
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,360
<font size="36">OK lady, you've won this round.</font>

223
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,520
<font size="36">But we can wait.</font>

224
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,560
<font size="36">You will slip up, and believe you me,
we will be there when you do.</font>

225
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,440
<font size="36">There will be some piece of evidence</font>

226
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,800
<font size="36">that will prove that you don't
know anything about computers.</font>

227
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,280
<font size="36">What are you doing?</font>

228
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,200
<font size="36">Plugging in your computer.</font>

229
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,160
<font size="36">It might be something
you say or something you do,</font>

230
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,040
<font size="36">but when we notice it,
and believe me we will notice it,</font>

231
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,680
<font size="36">it's going to be a long way down
for you sweet cheeks!</font>

232
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,400
<font size="36">He'll realise in a second.</font>

233
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,080
<font size="36">Ah-hhh!</font>

234
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,080
<font size="36">I cannot believe
you're going to tell on me.</font>

235
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,960
<font size="36">You're like a pair
of horrible old women.</font>

236
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,840
<font size="36">What did she say?</font>

237
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,880
<font size="36">She said we're like
horrible old women.</font>

238
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,600
<font size="36">She didn't!</font>

239
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,560
<font size="36">Hey guys. I hear you've got
something to tell me.</font>

240
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,040
<font size="36">Yes, well it's like this.</font>

241
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,600
<font size="36">Look at you, my IT team.</font>

242
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,640
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

243
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,920
<font size="36">Team players each
and every one of you.</font>

244
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,960
<font size="36">Yeah well she...</font>

245
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,120
<font size="36">There's no room for people who
can't act in a team on my team.</font>

246
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:15,800
<font size="36">PHONE RINGS</font>

247
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,520
<font size="36">Excuse me. Hello?</font>

248
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,000
<font size="36">What? Well, if you can't work
as a team you're all fired.</font>

249
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,960
<font size="36">That's it, you heard me, fired.</font>

250
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,880
<font size="36">Get your things and go.</font>

251
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,280
<font size="36">Hello, security?
Everyone on floor four is fired.</font>

252
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,240
<font size="36">Escort them from the
premises and do it as a team.</font>

253
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,240
<font size="36">If you're a team and if you can't
act as a team you're fired too!</font>

254
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,360
<font size="36">Dawn, get on to recruitment.</font>

255
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,240
<font size="36">Get them to look for a security
team that can work as a team.</font>

256
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,640
<font size="36">They may have to escort the current
security team from the building</font>

257
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,600
<font size="36">for not acting like a team.</font>

258
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,280
<font size="36">Team. Team. Team. Team. Team. Team.</font>

259
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,400
<font size="36">I even love saying the word team.</font>

260
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,680
<font size="36">You probably think that's a
picture of my family.</font>

261
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,480
<font size="36">Uh-uh, it's the A-Team.</font>

262
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:05,760
<font size="36">Bodie, Doyle, Tiger, the Jewellery
Man, the whole lot of them.</font>

263
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,960
<font size="36">So what do you want to tell me?</font>

264
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,200
<font size="36">Well, it's just not working out!</font>

265
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,240
<font size="36">He's joking.</font>

266
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,720
<font size="36">But you said...</font>

267
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,760
<font size="36">Not working out?</font>

268
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,800
<font size="36">Oh, no! We are getting on
like a big house on fire.</font>

269
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,320
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

270
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,360
<font size="36">My ear's getting hot.</font>

271
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,160
<font size="36">You know what we should leave now</font>

272
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,760
<font size="36">because you're a busy man and we've
taken up far too much of your time.</font>

273
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,000
<font size="36">Jen, could you just get
the door for me there?</font>

274
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,280
<font size="36">Absolutely, Roy.</font>

275
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,120
<font size="36">So why did you come here?</font>

276
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,240
<font size="36">We set up a voice activation
system on your computer.</font>

277
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,320
<font size="36">I think you're going to enjoy it.</font>

278
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,440
<font size="36">It might just take a little while
to get the pitch right on the voice,</font>

279
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,320
<font size="36">but nonetheless, go ahead.
Thank you, bye bye.</font>

280
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,840
<font size="36">Thank you. How exciting.</font>

281
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,360
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

282
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,040
<font size="36">Hello, computer.</font>

283
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,320
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

284
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,320
<font size="36">Hello.</font>

285
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,360
<font size="36">Hello, computer.</font>

286
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:15,920
<font size="36">But what good are you? You obviously
don't know anything about computers.</font>

287
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,480
<font size="36">No, but OK, but I can learn.</font>

288
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,000
<font size="36">You know, I mean for example, Moss,</font>

289
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,400
<font size="36">you could take me through
what you're doing right now.</font>

290
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,680
<font size="36">I'd be delighted.</font>

291
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,120
<font size="36">I'm just working on a very simple
piece of programming code...</font>

292
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:32,480
<font size="36">FUZZY CRACKLING</font>

293
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,880
<font size="36">I see.</font>

294
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,400
<font size="36">Oh, God, no, I'm lying again.</font>

295
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,200
<font size="36">I didn't understand any of that, I
don't know anything about computers.</font>

296
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,040
<font size="36">I'm absolutely useless to you, I
might as well pack up and go home.</font>

297
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:53,560
<font size="36">Hi, is Roy around?</font>

298
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,600
<font size="36">Hello there, little lady.</font>

299
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,520
<font size="36">Are you lost?
How can I help you? I'm Roy.</font>

300
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,960
<font size="36">You wanted me to come down, huh?
Well, here I am.</font>

301
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,080
<font size="36">Oh, not the face! Not the face!</font>

302
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,720
<font size="36">Yes, well maybe this will teach you</font>

303
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,120
<font size="36">to treat people
with a little it of respect!</font>

304
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,640
<font size="36">Is there any chance
we spoke on the phone earlier?</font>

305
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,160
<font size="36">Oh, my God are those Manolos?</font>

306
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,360
<font size="36">Oh, yes...</font>

307
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,360
<font size="36">They are gorgeous.
Were they expensive?</font>

308
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,080
<font size="36">No, no, no got them in a sale.</font>

309
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:31,520
<font size="36">Oh, clever you. I'm never lucky
enough to get a bargain like that.</font>

310
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,360
<font size="36">I should take you shopping.</font>

311
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,800
<font size="36">That would be fun.</font>

312
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,480
<font size="36">Oh, I'll give you a call.</font>

313
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,440
<font size="36">Nice to meet you. Take care.</font>

314
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,760
<font size="36">Nice meeting you!</font>

315
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,120
<font size="36">Chairman Wow! You just defused
that entire situation.</font>

316
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,280
<font size="36">What situation?</font>

317
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,600
<font size="36">Oh that, yeah, oh my God
does that happen a lot?</font>

318
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,040
<font size="36">They're fairly regular
the beatings, yes.</font>

319
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,360
<font size="36">I'd say we're on a
bi-weekly beating.</font>

320
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,440
<font size="36">Oh, it's not all that bad.</font>

321
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,480
<font size="36">Oh, come on Roy, it's pretty bad.</font>

322
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,520
<font size="36">Maybe I could help with this.</font>

323
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,760
<font size="36">I mean, I am a people person
and people like you need</font>

324
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,240
<font size="36">a person to deal with people.</font>

325
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,960
<font size="36">Oh, my God, ideas are coming,
things are happening here.</font>

326
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,160
<font size="36">OK, what would you say
if I told you that I had a plan</font>

327
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,080
<font size="36">to raise your profile upstairs
by 100%, what would you say?</font>

328
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,160
<font size="36">It can't be done, you're crazy.</font>

329
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,680
<font size="36">What would you say, Roy?
Roy's passed out.</font>

330
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,160
<font size="36">OK, I need a felt tip pen
and some paper.</font>

331
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,080
<font size="36"># THEME TUNE TO THE A-TEAM</font>

332
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,840
<font size="36">LAUGHTER</font>

333
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,920
<font size="36">No, no!</font>

334
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,960
<font size="36">Really, really it was
a true story, unbelievable.</font>

335
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,600
<font size="36">I don't know why we don't go out
with you IT guys. You're hilarious!</font>

336
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,680
<font size="36">Yes, we are!</font>

337
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,320
<font size="36">Well, you guys should come
down here more often, you know.</font>

338
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,200
<font size="36">You should see this as a new
era for Reynholm Industries.</font>

339
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,920
<font size="36">New era for Reynholm Industries.</font>

340
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:26,120
<font size="36">Oh, God, you know if you want
to hear something really funny,</font>

341
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,000
<font size="36">you should hear what happened
to Moss and I</font>

342
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:34,320
<font size="36">when we were so drunk in Amsterdam
that Moss lost his glasses. Moss!</font>

343
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,600
<font size="36">Moss! Come here, come here.</font>

344
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,280
<font size="36">Tell them that story about
when we were drunk in Amsterdam.</font>

345
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,480
<font size="36">Really?</font>

346
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,840
<font size="36">Yeah, this is brilliant.</font>

347
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,680
<font size="36">I'm just going to get
another box of wine.</font>

348
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,520
<font size="36">Well, go on then.</font>

349
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,560
<font size="36">All right.</font>

350
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,040
<font size="36">Well, one night
we were really drunk.</font>

351
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,000
<font size="36">Yeah.</font>

352
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,240
<font size="36">And we were so drunk that we
decided to hire prostitutes.</font>

353
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,560
<font size="36">When they arrived at the hotel
we were too scared to do anything
so we brought them to a fair.</font>

354
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,840
<font size="36">They were really nice. In the end
they only charged us half,</font>

355
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,800
<font size="36">but we did have to pay
for all the rides.</font>

356
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,080
<font size="36">Ha, ha! Isn't that just
the best story!</font>

357
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,760
<font size="36">Oh, no.</font>

358
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,120
<font size="36">You told me never to
tell that story to anyone.</font>

359
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,960
<font size="36">What are you talking about,
that's a brilliant story,</font>

360
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,840
<font size="36">Then you nearly walked
into the canal...</font>

361
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:40,840
<font size="36">Oh! You mean the story
where I lost my glasses.</font>

362
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,920
<font size="36">Yes.</font>

363
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,960
<font size="36">What story did you think I meant?</font>

364
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,440
<font size="36">Moss?</font>

365
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,640
<font size="36">What did you say? What did you say?</font>

366
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,640
<font size="36">It's all right for you two,</font>

367
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,240
<font size="36">you're used to
being social piranhas.</font>

368
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,840
<font size="36">I'm a very popular person usually.</font>

369
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,760
<font size="36">That girl earlier that tried to
beat me to death with her shoes.</font>

370
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,880
<font size="36">Did anybody get her number?</font>

371
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,520
<font size="36">That was a nice day
at the fair, wasn't it?</font>

372
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,000
<font size="36">With Brandy and Crystal.</font>

373
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,520
<font size="36">PHONE RINGS</font>

374
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,840
<font size="36">Hello, IT.</font>

375
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,040
<font size="36">Yeah, have you tried
turning it off and on again?</font>

376
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,000
<font size="36">Hello! Hello!</font>

377
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,560
<font size="36">Hello! Hello!</font>
